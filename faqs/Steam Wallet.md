Version 5  

[exclude_realm=china]  ### Note:
We have made some changes to how Steam Wallet Codes are redeemed on Steam, as part of our ongoing effort to reduce scams like the ones explained [HERE](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/paying-scammers-gift-cards). These changes should not impact regular customers who enjoy using Steam wallet codes they purchase at retail in their local currency.  
  
Each Steam User Account is associated with a specific currency, which you can see in the top right corner of your Steam Client.  Going forward, you may encounter an error if you try to activate a Steam Wallet Code issued in a different currency than the one of your Steam User Account.  
  
If you have questions about your ability to redeem Steam Wallet Codes, please contact [Steam Support](https://help.steampowered.com).  If you are concerned about the legitimacy of a Steam code you have purchased, you should ask your retailer.

#### What are Steam Wallet Codes?
Steam Wallet codes work just like gift cards which can be redeemed on your account for Steam Wallet credit and used for the purchase of games, software and any other item you can purchase on Steam. You can find Steam Wallet Codes at many retail stores across the World in a variety of denominations and different currencies.  
  
  ### Note:
Funds added to the Steam wallet will be used towards the next purchase(s) to the Steam account. Once depleted, another form of payment can be used.  
  
  
  
#### How do I redeem a Steam Wallet Code?

* Go to [https://store.steampowered.com/account/redeemwalletcode](https://store.steampowered.com/account/redeemwalletcode) and sign in if you aren't already. You will need to [create a Steam account](https://store.steampowered.com/join/) if you do not already have one.
* Once logged into Steam, please enter your unique Wallet code that you received into the "Steam Wallet Code" field.
* Click "Continue" to redeem the credit onto your account. Note: If you have never used Steam Wallet credit on your account, you may be prompted to enter your current address to determine the correct currency.

#### Are there country restrictions on Steam Wallet codes?
Yes. Each Steam User Account is associated with a specific currency, which you can see in the top right corner of your Steam Client. You may encounter an error if you try to activate a Steam Wallet Code issued in a different currency than the one of your Steam User Account.
