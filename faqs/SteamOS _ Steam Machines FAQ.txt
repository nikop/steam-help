SteamOS is our Linux-based operating system. The base system draws from Debian 8, code named Debian Jessie. Our work builds on top of the solid Debian core and optimizes it for a living room experience. Most of all, it’s an open Linux platform that gives you full control. You can take charge of your system and install the software and content that you want.

This error shows up if SteamOS fails to start the graphics driver and boot Steam. It can happen after a failed update, or if you have conflicting packages installed. The update installer should self-fix, but if you end up in a never-ending loop, try restoring from recovery and re-updating without cutting power. If all else fails, factory resetting your Steam Machine will fix the issue.
