This will help you easily see items in game early in the creation process in order to discover model or size problems when it\u0027s easier to make changes. You will need to adjust the model and textures to be within the item budget requirements before you can do the final submission to the workshop.[/*]  \t[*]There are now options to use the Demo Mode buttons for Refresh, Level Up and more in the workshop tool when testing items in game along with these workshop-specific options:  \t[list]  \t\t[*]\u0022Toggle Day/Night\u0022 - useful for testing items in different lighting.
