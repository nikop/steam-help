Before you begin:  
  

* Make sure your computer is VR-Ready by running the official [compatibility-testing app](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070910/Are_you_ready_for_Valve_Index/) from the Steam Store.
* Update your graphics drivers to the latest version. Refer to the [Updating Drivers article](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5799-495F-1F25-D15B) for more information.
* Install [SteamVR.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/)

[tr]    		[td][/td]  		[td]#### Pick a Play Area
Choose a play area that gives you enough room that your outstretched arms, including controllers, will not touch walls, ceiling, or objects around you. Make sure there are no stairs or windows within your space and that you have cleared any obstacles from the play area—including pets!  
  

* For Room Scale VR, you will need at least 2m x 1.5m (6.5ft x 5ft) of free space.
* Standing-only or seated setups require less space.

 [tr]    		[td][/td]  		[td]#### Set up your Index Base Stations
Make note of how high you are placing the base stations and keep in mind, that the base stations should always point toward the center of the play area. As an example, if you place a base station above your head height, you should tilt the base station down and toward the center of the play area. If you place it on a coffee table at knee height, you should tilt the base station upward and toward the center.  
  
Plug each base station into an outlet and remove the protective film from the base station lenses. The front LED should be on and visible when powered.  
  
For help mounting your Base Station, see the section below.
