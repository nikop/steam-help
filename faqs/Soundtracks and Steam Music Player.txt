----------------------------------

Version 4

Soundtracks are purchasable on Steam as standalone music products or as DLC specific to a parent game (deprecated method). Some soundtracks were also included as bonus content for much older games on Steam.
With the Steam Music Player, you can access all of your soundtracks as well as any other non-steam music files that are installed on your computer.
[h1]How do I access my soundtracks?[/h1]Soundtracks are automatically added to your Library when purchased, but you'll still need to install them.
The method for installing a soundtrack depends on what type of app it is. All new soundtracks are delivered as [i]music apps[/i]. For some older soundtracks, you'll need to install the game they are associated with in order to access them as DLC. We're in the process of converting all pre-exisiting DLC sountracks to music apps
