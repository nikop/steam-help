Who has a free account?[/b]\n\nAnyone who has downloaded the game for free and has not made a purchase in the in-game Mann Co. Store has a free account.\n\n[b]Q. Who has a premium account?[/b]\n\nIf you\u0027ve ever spent money on Team Fortress 2, you have a premium account. This includes purchasing the game before it was Free-To-Play, receiving the game as a gift that was purchased, activating a retail version, or making a purchase in the Mann Co. in-game store.\n\n[b]Q. How is a free account different than a premium account?[/b]\n\nPremium accounts have a few extra features including access to rare and cosmetic items through random item drops, 300 backpack slots to start compared to 50 for free accounts, and more powerful trading and crafting abilities. Otherwise, however, the gameplay experience will be identical for both accounts.\n\n[b]Account Comparison:[/b]\n\n[table]                [tr]              [td] [/td]              [td][b]Free[/b][/td]              [td][b]Premium[/b][/td]          [/tr]          [tr]              [td]Backpack:[/td]              [td]50 slots (expandable up to 2750)[/td]              [td]300 slots (expandable up to 3000)[/td]          [/tr]          [tr]              [td]Items:[/td]              [td]Standard[/td]              [td]Standard, Rare, and Cosmetic[/td]          [/tr]          [tr]              [td]Crafting:[/td]              [td]Limited blueprints, crafted items untradable[/td]              [td]All blueprints, all previous and future crafted items tradable[/td]          [/tr]          [tr]              [td]Trading:[/td]              [td]Receive items only, received items are tradable[/td]              [td]Full trading[/td]          [/tr]          [tr]              [td]Gifting:[/td]              [td]Can receive gifts[/td]              [td]Can send and receive gifts[/td]          [/tr]        [/table]\n\n[b]Q.

How does Free-to-Play affect existing users?[/b]\n\nIt doesn\u0027t.
