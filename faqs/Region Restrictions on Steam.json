However, products purchased as gifts may have region restrictions. Please see the [url=#gifts]gifts section[/url] for more information.\n\n[h2]How will I know if a product has region restrictions?[/h2]\nMost products purchased for yourself on Steam do not have region restrictions.  Any region restriction on a product will be clearly noted on the product\u0027s Steam Store page as shown below:\n[img]https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/regionrestrictions/storerunrestriction.png[/img]\n\n\n[h2]What if I am traveling and the product I am trying to purchase has a note about region restrictions?[/h2]\nIf you are currently traveling, please ensure that your store region is correctly set to the country where you permanently reside as shown below. You may view and change your store region from your [url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/]Account Details[/url] page. [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/2B3F-DAEF-846B-A0E8]Learn how to change your store country[/url].\n\n[img]https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/regionrestrictions/storecountry.png[/img]\n\n[h1][b]CD Keys[/b][/h1][hr][/hr]   \n[h2]I purchased a CD key from another retailer. Is it restricted to a certain region?[/h2]\nRegion restrictions on CD Keys vary by each individual publisher. There is no standard or universal restriction placed on retail games.\n\n[h2]How do I know when a CD Key or retail product is region restricted?[/h2]\nRegion restrictions on CD Keys should be noted by the publisher on the retail packaging of the product. To be safe, ask the retailer if there are any region restrictions on this product before purchasing. If you have issues with the purchased product, please contact the retail store where it was purchased.\n\n[h2]I\u2019m getting an error \u0022[i]Game not available in your territory[/i]\u0022 when I\u2019m trying to add a CD Key to my account. What should I do?[/h2]\nYou will see this error message if you have purchased a regionally restricted copy of a game and you try to register its CD Key in a different region. If you do not live in the designated region for that game you must contact the seller for a refund. Steam Support cannot offer refunds on CD Keys purchased from 3rd party retailers.\n\n[url id=gifts][/url]\n[h1][b]Steam Gifts[/b][/h1][hr][/hr]\n[h2]Are Steam gifts region restricted?[/h2]\nGifts purchased in certain regions can be redeemed only in those regions. When you purchase a gift you will be notified at checkout of any restrictions that will be placed on the gift. An example of a gift purchase in Russia and the countries that the gift can be redeemed in is shown below:\n\n[img]https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/regionrestrictions/giftcartrestriction.png[/img]\n\n[h2]How do I know if a certain country is included in a specific region on Steam?[/h2]\nThe exact countries where a gift can be redeemed in are shown during purchase. Please see the above image as an example. The countries that are included in a specific region are subject to change.\n\n[h2]I received a Steam gift. How will I know if it has a region restriction?[/h2]\nEach gift will clearly note in the gift\u0027s description which countries it can be redeemed in. You can view the description from your [url=steam://open/inventory]Steam gift inventory[/url].\n\n[h2]How will a region restricted gift appear to me in my inventory?[/h2]\nWhen a gift is region restricted there will be a red notification icon in the corner of the gift\u0027s image. There will also be a list of countries that the gift can be redeemed in within the gift\u0027s description as shown below:\n\n[img]https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/regionrestrictions/fullinventorywithrestrictedgifts.png[/img]\n\n[h2]Can I find out before I trade for a game whether it is region restricted?[/h2]\nYou will see the red notification icon in the corner of the gift\u0027s image.
