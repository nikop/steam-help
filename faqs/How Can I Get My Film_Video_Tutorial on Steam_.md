# How Can I Get My Film/Video/Tutorial on Steam?

As of January 8th 2019, the requirements for distributing video content on Steam have changed.  
  
Video content should be: 
* Directly related to gaming
* Accessory content for games sold on Steam
* Accessory content for software sold on Steam
* A Steam 360 Video

If your video content falls into one of these categories and you're an existing Steamworks Partner, please [submit a ticket](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=924) and provide a description of the video content you'd like to distribute.  
  
  
## How do I get started adding video content to Steam if I'm not a Steamworks partner?
The first step is to email us at [**video@valvesoftware.com**](mailto:video@valvesoftware.com) **** and provide the following information:  
  

* A short description of your video content and/or a link to a trailer or preview video.
* Please supply a Steam Account name that belongs to someone at your company with the authority to sign contracts and enter banking and tax information.
