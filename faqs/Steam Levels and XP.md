### Who can level up their Steam Community profile?
Anyone who is not a [limited user](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A) will earn a Steam level based on their account's current badges and games. You must create your Steam Community profile to view your Steam level. [Limited users](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A) do not qualify for Steam levels and will remain at level 0.  
  
  
### How do I increase XP on my profile to level up?
There are a number of ways to increase your profile level on Steam. These include:  

* Purchasing games
* Earning badges
* Crafting badges
* Upgrading badges

  
For more information about your Steam level and how to increase it, please see the [Trading Cards FAQ.](http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq)  
  
  
### What does having Steam Levels give you?
  

* The maximum amount of friends is initially capped at 250 for accounts. For every Level gained, you will be able to have 5 more friend slots. This can expand to a maximum of 2000 total possible friends.
* For every 10 Levels gained, you will receive 1 Showcase slot. These can be used to display a unique Showcase on the Profile (achievements, videos, screenshots, etc.). This can expand to a maximum of 20 at this time but more may be added in the future. Note: if you have bought an extra Showcase on the Points Shop, that adds an extra Showcase slot on top of the maximum.

  
  
### I have badges, but my XP is stuck at 100 on level 0. What is wrong?
[Limited users](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A) do not qualify for Steam levels. If you are a [limited user](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A), your XP will not increase and your level with remain at 0. For more information on limited users and how to become unlimited, please see the [Limited Users FAQ](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A).  
  
  
### I bought a game, but my XP only increased by x amount. Shouldn't it be more?
The XP that you have earned is the correct amount. For further insight, you may try searching or posting on [the Steam Discussions](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/tradingcards/discussions/1/).
