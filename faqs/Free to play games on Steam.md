### What is a free to play game?
Free to play games are available to download for free and can be played without a subscription or a credit card. Your Steam wallet allows you to purchase items and content in-game to customize your gameplay if supported by the specific game.  
  
### Will I need a credit card to play?
No, free to play games are free to download and play.  
  
### Will I need to fund my Steam Wallet?
If you wish to purchase in-game items or content, you will need to fund your Steam Wallet. Please see the [Steam Wallet](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/78E3-7431-1E88-AD59) FAQ for more information.  
  
### Will my free to play account have limitations or restrictions?
Any Steam Account that does not own a purchased game or have a funded Steam Wallet is considered a "Limited User." We have chosen to limit access to some community features as a means of protecting our customers from those who abuse Steam merely for purposes such as spamming and phishing.
