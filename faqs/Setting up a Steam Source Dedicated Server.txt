[section id=account][h4]Setting up a Steam Dedicated Server Account[/h4][/section]To run the Steam Source Dedicated Server you will first need to install Steam. You may download and install Steam from: [url=http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=getsteamnow]Download Steam[/url]

After installing Steam, you must create a Steam account to run your dedicated server. This is separate from the Steam account you normally use to play games. If you attempt to run a dedicated server from your normal Steam account, you will not be able to join your server using the same account.
