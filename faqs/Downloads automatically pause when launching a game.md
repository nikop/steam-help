# Downloads automatically pause when launching a game

Why do downloads in Steam stop when I begin playing a game?  
  
Steam automatically pauses your downloads when a game is launched in order to prioritize the network activity for the game itself.  
  
You can turn this feature off by navigating to your download settings: *Steam > Settings > Downloads*. From here, check the *Allow Downloads During Gameplay* box.  
  
If the download is affecting the network performance of the game, you can also consider setting a bandwidth limit from the download settings.
