## Connection Issues
  ### Note:
Steam does not support connecting through a network DMZ (de-militarized zone), so this setting must be disabled in your router for Steam to function. For more information, please follow our guide to [Using a Router with Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/46D2-B5B1-F0B9-B867).  
Many Steam issues can be caused by a firewall, anti-virus, or a problem with your router or internet connection.  
  
Please use the [Troubleshooting Network Connectivity](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/669A-2F68-D1D1-A5EC) guide to ensure that your network is properly configured for use with Steam.
