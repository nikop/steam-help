[url id=misswal][/url][h1]Common Questions[/h1]
[h4]Where did my Steam Wallet funds go?[/h4]
By default, Steam will always try to use your Steam Wallet funds first when a purchase is made. On the purchase confirmation screen, if you do not switch your intended payment method away from the Wallet, your Wallet funds will be spent. Check your purchase confirmation emails for all of your recent purchases for more information.

[url id=xtrac][/url][h4]Do I get an extra copy to gift if I own a game twice?[/h4]
Unless otherwise stated, you will not receive extra giftable copies for duplicate purchases on a single Steam account.

[url id=giftpur][/url][h4]The "Purchase as a gift" option is not available on checkout. Why?[/h4]
For various reasons, such as common issues, incompatibility with non-Steam versions, or regional restrictions that are required by the game's developer or publisher, some games and addons cannot be gifted.

All multi-pack offers, such as 2, 3, and 4-packs, contain between one and three giftable subscriptions and one subscription towards your own account. If you already have the subscription on your account, you will not be able to purchase the multi-pack, even if your intention is to send all copies as gifts.

[url id=missedsale][/url][h4]I recently purchased a game that is now on sale. Can I refund the difference?[/h4]
We are unable to refund the difference in price; however, you [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/784C-923B-A4A1-C825]may request a refund[/url] for the initial purchase and repurchase the game at the current sale price.

[url id=ownershipcheck][/url][h4]I cannot find the content that the Steam Store says that I own. Why?[/h4]
Due to current technical limitations, The Steam Store may show that you own a special edition of a game when you actually only own the base version. You can check your purchase/activation history to determine which version of this game you own using the following method:

[olist]


[*]Log in to your Steam account through the Steam application.

[*]In the upper right hand corner, click your profile name and select "Account Details" from the drop down list.

[*]Click on "View purchase history" to list your Steam Store transactions, Market purchases, and in-game items or currency purchases. The details include the date of purchase, name of the game or item(s) purchased, and the transaction amount.

[url id=coupons][/url][h4]I have a coupon that I wish to use. Does it stack with a Steam Sale?[/h4]
Unless clearly stated otherwise, promotions such as coupons or loyalty discounts do not stack with Steam Sale pricing.

[url id=wishlist][/url][h4]How can I avoid missing sales for the games that I want?[/h4]
Steam's Wishlist feature can be used to receive a notification when a game that you want goes on sale. You can find more information on how to use the Steam Wishlist feature here:
