  ## How are Overwatch bans issued?
Overwatch bans are issued when selected members of the CS:GO Community, called 'Investigators', watch a replay from a reported player's match and vote on one or many offenses they believe the player, known as the 'Suspect', committed.  
  
Overwatch cases are generated based on a number of factors, and once a case is created it is issued to multiple Overwatch Investigators who vote on convictions for griefing, cheating, both offenses, or none. If Overwatch Investigators unanimously agree on a conviction a Minor or Major ban will be issued to the Suspect.    
  ## What evidence is available to Investigators?
Investigators are shown a replay of a randomly selected eight-round segment from a reported player's match. Their task is to determine whether or not that player has committed any offense(s) during that replay.  
  
Suspected players are referred to as 'The Suspect' and the other players' names, in-game text, and voice chat are omitted. The Investigator is expected to make a determination solely based on the actions of the Suspect.    
  ## I have received a Minor Overwatch ban. What does this mean?
Minor Overwatch bans are issued for griefing in-game and last a minimum of 30 days. For the duration of your ban you will not be able to play on VAC-secured servers or trade or market your CS:GO items.  
  
After the minimum 30 day ban expires you will again be able to play on VAC-secured servers and trade and market your CS:GO items. Please note, a second Minor Overwatch ban may result in a permanent ban on your account.    
  ## I have received a Major Overwatch ban. What does this mean?
Major Overwatch bans are issued for cheating and are permanent. Going forward, you will not be able to play on VAC-secured servers or trade or market your CS:GO items. If you would like to play CS:GO on VAC-secured servers you will need to create a new Steam account.    
  ## How does a player end up being a Suspect in an Overwatch case?
Players become Suspects when their pattern of being reported exceeds or otherwise stands out from those of their peers. They may have a sudden spike in reports, or they may have built up many reports over a long period of time. Regardless, our data shows the Suspects in Overwatch cases need to be reviewed for a variety of possible offenses.    
  ## Can I appeal my Overwatch ban?
No. Overwatch bans of any kind cannot be appealed and are not removed at Steam Support. Because bans are only issued when Investigators *unanimously* agree on a conviction we are confident that applied Overwatch bans should remain. If even one Overwatch Investigator does not agree on a conviction the Suspect will not receive a ban of any kind.    
  ## I believe I was reported by low skill players for cheating which resulted in my Overwatch ban. Can the ban be removed?
No. Even if you were reported by lower skill players, Overwatch Investigators are chosen from various higher Skill Groups to ensure we have coverage from a variety of CS:GO player types.  
  
It isn't necessary for a player to be exceptionally skilled to be a good Overwatch Investigator. For example, we would expect casters to be good Investigators regardless of their skill level given their experience in observing highly skilled play.    
  ## Can I move my CS:GO items to a different Steam account?
No. Items and games cannot be moved from an Overwatch banned account to a different account, however, new games can still be purchased and registered on an Overwatch banned account and the account can still receive items, but not send them.  
  
Players with Minor Overwatch bans can trade and market items once the ban expires. Players with Major Overwatch bans will not be able to trade or market their CS:GO items going forward because the ban is permanent.
