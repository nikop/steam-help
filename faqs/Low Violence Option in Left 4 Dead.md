Version 4  

How can I lower the violence and content for Left 4 Dead?  
  
  ### Important:
Some countries require low violence to be permanently enabled. If you live in a country where low violence settings are required, you will be unable to remove the low violence version.  #### Launch in Low Violence Mode

* Locate Left 4 Dead in your Library and right-click the game.
* Select "Properties..."
* Go to the **Launch Options** section on the General tab in the Properties window.

  
  
In the Launch Options field, type "-lv" as shown in the example below:  
  
![{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/4bc0a402f254c490f39759406ff68d57d0b26363.png]({STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/4bc0a402f254c490f39759406ff68d57d0b26363.png)  
  
Close the Properties window, and then launch Left 4 Dead. The game should run with less bodies, limbs, and other content.
