Normal weapon skins cannot be used in a Trade Up Contract with StatTrak weapon skins and vice versa.\n\nTo verify if a weapon can be used in a Trade Up Contract, hover over the weapon in your CS:GO Inventory and look for the Collection it\u0027s included in. If the weapon\u0027s grade is the highest in its Collection it can [i]not[/i] be used in a Trade Up Contract.\n\n[b]Note:[/b] Covert (red) weapon skins can not be used in Trade Up Contracts.[/section]    \n[section id=weaponwear]  [h2]The skin I received isn\u0027t the weapon wear I\u0027d like. Why is this?[/h2]Regardless of the weapon wear on the skins you\u0027re trading up, the weapon wear on the skin you receive will be randomized, meaning you may receive a Battle-Scarred skin even if you trade up all Factory New skins. This result is always randomized and cannot be controlled by trading up skins with a specific weapon wear.[/section]    \n[section id=whatarent]  [h2]What are Name Tags?[/h2]Name Tags in CS:GO are single use in-game items which allow players to nickname their weapons. Name Tags cannot be modified once they\u0027ve been applied to a weapon.\n\nTo remove a Name Tag on an existing weapon, left-click on the weapon, select \u0027Rename\u0027, then \u0027Remove Name\u0027.\n\nName Tags can be purchased for $1.99 USD in-game or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Community Market[/url].[/section]    \n[section id=characters]  [h2]What characters can I use on a Name Tag?[/h2]The following characters can be used on Name Tags:\n[list]  [*]a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z[/*]  [*]A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z[/*]  [*]0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9[/*]  [*]\u0060!@#$%^\u0026*-\u002B=(){}[]/|\\,.?:;\u0027_ (and \u0022space\u0022, but Name Tags can\u0027t start with spaces)[/*]  [/list][b]Note:[/b] Any characters not listed here are not supported on Name Tags and may not display properly.[/section]    \n[section id=tagposition]  [h2]Can I change the position of the Name Tag on a weapon?[/h2]No. Name Tags have a pre-determined location on each weapon which cannot be changed.[/section]    \n[section id=whatarestick]  [h2]What are Stickers?[/h2]Stickers in CS:GO are single use in-game items that can be applied to one of four locations on each weapon.\n\nStickers can be scraped once they\u0027ve been applied to a weapon to change their appearance. To do this, left-click on a weapon in your CS:GO Inventory which has Stickers, select \u0027Scrape Sticker\u0027, and click on the Sticker you\u0027d like to scrape.\n\nStickers can be purchased through in-game offers or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Community Market[/url].\n\n[b]Note:[/b] Scraping a Sticker cannot be undone - once you have clicked on a Sticker to scrape it the results are permanent.[/section]    \n[section id=movesticker]  [h2]I have applied a Sticker and would like to move it. Can I do this?[/h2]No. Once a Sticker has been placed on a weapon it cannot be moved. If you\u0027d like to remove the Sticker you will need to scrape it in-game until the \u0027Remove Sticker\u0027 option appears.\n\n[b]Note:[/b] Removing a Sticker from a weapon is permanent and the Sticker will not be returned to your Inventory.[/section]    \n[section id=stickergone]  [h2]Stickers on my weapon are not visible when I inspect in-game. Why is this?[/h2]Stickers on your weapon may not be visible because they\u0027ve been heavily scraped. When Stickers are scraped they lose their vibrance and eventually won\u0027t be visible on the weapon when inspecting it. Stickers that have been heavily scraped will only leave an outline of the original sticker.\n\nYou\u0027re free to completely remove the sticker by scraping it further using the in-game UI.[/section]    \n[section id=swaptool]  [h2]What is a StatTrak Swap Tool?[/h2]StatTrak Swap Tools are single use items which allow players to transfer kill counts from one StatTrak weapon skin to another so long as the weapon is the same. Kills from a StatTrak M4A1-S can only be transferred to another StatTrak M4A1-S using a Swap Tool, [i]not[/i] to another weapon.\n\nStatTrak Swap Tools can be purchased for $.99 USD in-game or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Community Market[/url].[/section]    \n[h2]Graffiti information[/h2]Detailed information about CS:GO Graffiti can be found in our [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/24B9-AB5C-4C72-9309]Graffiti Help Article[/url].[/section]  \n  \n[section id=whatissu]  [h2]What are Storage Units?[/h2]Storage Units are in-game items used to expand and better organize your CS:GO Inventory. A Storage Unit adds an additional 1,000 item capacity to your CS:GO Inventory.[/section]    \n[section id=howdoisu]  [h2]How do I get a Storage Unit?[/h2]Storage Units can be purchased in-game for $1.99.[/section]    \n[section id=whoneedssu]  [h2]Who needs a Storage Unit?[/h2]Any user who wants to hold more than 1,000 items in their CS:GO Inventory will need a Storage Unit. Even if you have not reached the 1,000 item Inventory limit, Storage Units can be labeled and used as a way to more effectively organize your CS:GO Inventory.[/section]    \n[section id=depositsu]  [h2]How do I deposit items to a Storage Unit?[/h2]There are two ways to deposit items into a Storage Unit:\n[list]  [*]Click on an item in your Inventory, select \u0027Move to Storage Unit\u0027, and select the Storage Unit you would like to move the item to.[/*]  [*]Click on the Storage Unit in your Inventory and select \u0027Deposit Items\u0027, then select which items you would like to add to the Storage Unit.[/*]  [/list]  [b]Note:[/b] default weapons, agents, gloves, and Music Kits cannot be added to Storage Units, and any item in a Storage Unit will not appear in your Steam Community Inventory until it is retrieved.  [/section]       \n[section id=retrievesu]  [h2]How do I retrieve items from a Storage Unit?[/h2]There are two ways to retrieve items from a Storage Unit:\n[list]  [*]Click on a Storage Unit in your Inventory and select \u0027Retrieve Items\u0027, then click on the item(s) you would like to retrieve.[/*]  [*]Click on a Storage Unit in your Inventory and select \u0027Inspect\u0027, then select the item(s) you would like to retrieve and click RETRIEVE at the bottom of the screen.[/*]  [/list]  [/section]       \n[section id=whereretrieve]  [h2]I retrieved an item but can not find it in my Inventory. Where did it go?[/h2]When items are retrieved from a Storage Unit they are added back to your CS:GO Inventory in the same location they were prior to being deposited. Retrieved items will not appear at the top of your CS:GO Inventory.\n\nIf you can not find the retrieved item we suggest scrolling through your Inventory or searching for the item using \u0027Search Items\u0027. It is not possible to lose items you are depositing or retrieving from Storage Units because they never leave your account.[/section]    \n[section id=interactsu]  [h2]How can I interact with items placed in a Storage Unit?[/h2]Any item in a Storage Unit cannot be equipped, consumed, traded, marketed, renamed, or altered until it is retrieved to your Inventory.[/section]    \n[section id=tradesu]  [h2]Can I trade or market items in a Storage Unit?[/h2]No, you would need to take the items out of the Storage Unit first. Storage Units are singular in purpose and only meant for holding items. Storage units with or without items cannot be traded, marketed, or deleted from an account.[/section]    \n[section id=renamesu]  [h2]How often can I rename a Storage Unit?[/h2]Storage Units can be renamed as often as you would like. To rename a Storage Unit click on it in your Inventory and select \u0027Change Label\u0027.[/section]    \n[section id=whatarepatches]  [h2]What are Patches?[/h2]Patches in CS:GO are single use in-game items that can be applied to any Agent you own.\n\nOnce applied, a Patch\u2019s location cannot be changed; the Patch can only be removed from the Agent. Like Stickers on a weapon, any Patches applied to an Agent will remain if it is bought or sold on the Steam Community Market.[/section]    \n[section id=movepatch]  [h2]I have applied a Patch and would like to move it. Can I do this?[/h2]No. Once a Patch has been applied it cannot be moved. If you would like to remove a Patch you will need to click \u2018REMOVE PATCH\u2019 in-game.\n\n[b]Note:[/b] Removing a Patch from an Agent is permanent and the Patch will not be returned to your Inventory.[/section]      \n[section id=whichagents]  [h2]Which Agents can I apply Patches to?[/h2]Patches can be applied to any Agent you own but cannot be applied to default (local) agents.\n\nA link to Community Market listings for Agents that Patches can be applied to can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=730\u0026q=Agent]here[/url].[/section]",
