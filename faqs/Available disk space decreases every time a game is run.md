# Available disk space decreases every time a game is run

The amount of available disk space on my machine decreases every time I run a game - what should I do?  
  
  ### Important:
Disabling System Restore for any drive which you do not back up regularly is **not** recommended.  
There are several causes for this condition which this article will not cover:  

* Game patches and updates are being downloaded automatically through Steam
* Files for saved games are being created (for single-player games)
* Custom content downloads are occurring (for multiplayer games)

  
If you notice that **50 - 100 MB** of available hard disk space is being used every time you start a game, you may need to disable System Restore for the drive which is storing your game files.
