I'm having video and display problems in a Valve/Source game, how do I change my video and display settings during launch?


[section style=important][h5]Check Drivers are recently Updated[/h5]
If you have not recently changed your video settings and you are experiencing video and display problems, please ensure your video drivers and DirectX are updated before proceeding:

If that does not resolve the issue you can try using the launch options below to try and troubleshoot the issue.

[b]Note:[/b] The following processes are suggested only for Valve games. These options will have no effect when launching other Steam games.

[section id=#autoconfig][h1]How do I set the autoconfig launch option?[/h1]
[/section]
The [i]-autoconfig[/i] launch option will allow Steam to configure a Valve/Source game with the best settings for use on your machine.

[olist]

[*]Open Steam [/*]

[*]Go to the "Library" [/*]

[*]Right-click the game which needs to be reconfigured [/*]

[*]Select "Properties..." from the menu [/*]

[*]Go to the section "Launch Options" [/*]

[*]Remove any launch options currently shown in the input box [/*]

[*]Type [i]-autoconfig [/i]in the box [/*]

[/olist]


[section id=#safe][h1]How do I set the safe mode launch option?[/h1]
[/section]
The [i]-safe[/i] launch option will cause the game to launch with minimal video settings, in windowed mode and with a 640 x 480 resolution. This can be helpful for solving video configuration problems.

[olist]

[*]Open Steam [/*]

[*]Go to the "Library" [/*]

[*]Right-click the game which needs to be reconfigured [/*]

[*]Select "Properties..." from the menu [/*]

[*]Go to the section "Launch Options" [/*]

[*]Remove any launch options currently shown in the input box [/*]

[*]Type [i]-safe [/i]in the box. [/*]

[/olist]



[section id=#force][h1]How do I force a working DirectX level and video mode?[/h1]
[/section]
If the Valve/Source game fails to load with the default settings, you will need to test for a working DirectX level and video mode.

[h4]Force a DirectX level[/h4]This process may help with some older video cards - some users report the game will run faster, as well:

[*]Select "Properties..." from the menu [/*]

[*]Go to the section "Launch Options" [/*]

[*]Remove any launch options currently shown in the input box [/*]

[*]Type one of the DirectX level launch options specified below in the box  [/*]

[*][i]-dxlevel 90 [/i](DirectX v9.0) [/*]

[*][i]-dxlevel 81 [/i](DirectX v8.1) [/*]

[*][i]-dxlevel 80 [/i](DirectX v8.0) [/*]

[/list]
