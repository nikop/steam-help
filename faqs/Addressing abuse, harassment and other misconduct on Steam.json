Doing so will decrease the likelihood of your account being the target of malicious activities.\n\n[list]  \n[*][h3]Keep Your Personal Info Safe[/h3]\nMalicious activity often relies on access to your personal information. Never post personally identifiable information on Steam, even in private chats or other areas that you might think are safe. Someone else can always decide to make this content public.\n\nYou should also review your Steam [url=https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings]privacy options[/url] and be aware of what components of your profile are public.\n\n[*][h3]Protect Your Account[/h3]\nAccount security is something that you can control. Take advantage of Steam\u0027s security features and never let anyone access or borrow your account, regardless of the reason.\n\nYou can find more information and resources in our dedicated [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6639-EB3C-EC79-FF60]Account Security Recommendations[/url] article.\n\n[*][h3]Engage In Responsible Steam Behavior[/h3]\nMake sure that you are following the Steam [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6862-8119-C23E-EA7B]Rules \u0026 Guidelines[/url] and that you are not engaging in activities that violate the Steam subscriber agreement. Activities like this will potentially expose your account to other bad actors, making it a target of malicious activity.\n\n[*][h3]Unfriending and Leaving Groups[/h3]\nDon\u0027t participate in groups or befriend users that are involved in harassment, scamming, or other malicious activities. Associating with players or groups that are involved in inappropriate activity will increase the likelihood that you become a target.\n\n[*][h3]Don\u2019t Engage The Other Party[/h3]\nWhether it\u0027s scamming, harassment, spamming or any other malicious activity, do not engage the party that is responsible. A reaction typically results in even more dedication to the activity by the other party. We recommend ignoring the behavior and utilizing the appropriate resources outlined in this FAQ.\n[/list]",
