[section style=important]Games may not launch for a number of reasons, most of which are hard to diagnose due to the number of unique hardware and software configurations users have. When it appears games aren't launching this is because they're crashing immediately after launching for various reasons, many of which can be self-solved.
The information in this article is written as a general guide to help rule out common issues and should be followed after a fresh restart of your machine. If the information here does [i]not[/i] help we recommend reaching out to the game's developer for in-depth support. It may also be necessary to see a local PC technician for help with your individual configuration.

If game itself does not support Linux but you are trying to run it using the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561]Steam Play Proton[/url] feature for Linux, we recommend checking the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/8/]Steam Play community discussion[/url] forum as other users may have encountered the same problem and have suggestions.
