[section style=important]Games may not launch for a number of reasons, most of which are hard to diagnose due to the number of unique hardware and software configurations users have. When it appears games aren't launching this is because they're crashing immediately after launching for various reasons, many of which can be self-solved.

The information in this article is written as a general guide to help rule out common issues and should be followed after a fresh restart of your machine. If the information here does [i]not[/i] help we recommend reaching out to the game's developer for in-depth support. It may also be necessary to see a local PC technician for help with your individual configuration.[/section]

[h1]Mac users[/h1]   [section id=updatemacos]  [h3]Update macOS[/h3]If you're running an older version of macOS there may be conflicts with the game you're trying to run. To update macOS:

[/section]    [section id=sysreqmac]  [h3]Check the game's system requirements[/h3]First, double-check that the game or DLC is specifically available for Mac.

Please compare your machine's specs against the game's system requirements on the store page, and note that a machine at or near system requirements may experience performance and/or launch issues when playing.[/section]
