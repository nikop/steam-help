You might need to do this if you are unable to boot, have installed another OS and would like to get back to standard Deck SteamOS, or are experiencing other breaking issues.\n\nFor all the tinkerers out there, please note that this system image is not quite SteamOS 3 yet. Depending on what you try to install it on (desktop, another handheld, refrigerator, toaster), it may not work properly. SteamOS 3 proper will come out sometime after launch (and even then it may not work on your toaster).\n\n\n[h2]Steam Deck Recovery Instructions[/h2]\n[olist]\n[*] Download the recovery image [url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck]here (click)[/url].\n[*] Prepare a USB key (8GB minimum) with the recovery image:\n[list]\n\n[*] On [b]Windows [/b]we recommend using the [url=https://rufus.ie/en/]Rufus utility[/url].
