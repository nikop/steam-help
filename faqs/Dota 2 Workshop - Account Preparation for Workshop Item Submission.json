You will have to wait until they have accepted your friend invite before you can continue. \n \n27.

Once this person has accepted the link request you can proceed.\n\n[url id=finalize][/url]\n\n[h2]FINALIZING YOUR SUBMISSION TO THE DOTA 2 WORKSHOP[/h2]33. Click Save to finalize your submission.\n\nNOTE: Revenue shares cannot be changed on an item once it has been submitted.

It may have been removed by the author.\u0022, check these two things:\n\n[list]  \t[*]Make sure you are logged in under the account that submitted the item if it is a hidden item.

Optional: If a pre-approved [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=570#service_providers]Service Provider[/url] has assisted you with your items, you have the option to give them a percentage of Valve\u0027s revenue:\n\n[img]http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/workshop_account_preparation/service_providers.jpg?v=1459382400[/img]\n\nThank you for taking the time to review these detailed instructions.
