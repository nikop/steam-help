# Verify Integrity of Game Files

If you are missing textures or other content in game or experiencing crashing while playing a game, you can have Steam verify that the game's files are installed correctly on the computer.  
[section style=section] 
* Restart your computer and launch **Steam**
* Next, you can either right click the game in your Library, or click the gear icon from the game's Library page on the far right
*  From the drop down menu, select **Properties...**
* Select the **Local Files** tab and click the **Verify integrity of game files...** button ![{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/48bde6da12dec86f0d07bb36d4949ee02e3f5f3d.png]({STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/48bde6da12dec86f0d07bb36d4949ee02e3f5f3d.png)
* Steam will verify the game's files - this process may take several minutes![{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/2633d7ae8d4b626f6b31dc918a571b5ce53cb323.png]({STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/2633d7ae8d4b626f6b31dc918a571b5ce53cb323.png)

 [/section]     [section style=note] ### **Important:** One or more files may fail to verify.
This is normal for most Steam games. The files that fail to verify are local configuration files that should not be replaced as part of this process. **You can safely ignore this message.**[/section]    [section style=warning] ### Warning:
Do not run the verification process while performing other system-intensive processes, such as defragmenting your hard drive or scanning for viruses.  
  
Do not run this process for multiple games at the same time.[/section]
