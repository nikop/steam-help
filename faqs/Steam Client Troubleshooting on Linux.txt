[h5]Check Video Drivers[/h5]You will want to install a 32-bit OpenGL program and make sure it runs properly, as most issues with Steam starting up on Linux are due to problems with the installation OpenGL drivers, or the lack of drivers entirely.

On Ubuntu, the easiest way to verify this is by installing mesa-utils:i386 and running glxinfo from a console.
