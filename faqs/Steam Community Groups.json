  "content": "Community groups are user-created hubs where members can share interests, coordinate gaming activities and host discussions in group-specific forums.\n\nTools are also available to group owners and admins, making it possible to control membership, curate content, and manage the privileges available to other members.\n\n[section style=important]  [h5]Limited accounts[/h5]Some group features are not available on limited accounts. More details can be found in the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A]Limited Account FAQ[/url].[/section]\n\n[h1]Group Creation \u0026 Management[/h1]Once you\u0027ve decided to create a group, you can begin the process [url=http://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate]here[/url].\n\nAny non-Limited account can own up to 10 groups.\n\n[h3]Changing Group Names[/h3]Make sure to decide on a unique name and abbreviation. Group names cannot be changed once the group has been created.\n\n[h3]Deleting Groups[/h3]When all members have left a group, the group will automatically be deleted by the system. Groups cannot be manually deleted.\n\n[h3]Transferring Ownership[/h3]When the current owner leaves the group, the oldest Officer (by join date) will be promoted to owner. If no eligible Officers are available, the oldest Moderator will inherit ownership. If there are no Moderators in the group, the oldest group member will be promoted to owner. The ownership of a group cannot be manually transferred.\n\n\n[h1]Group Membership[/h1]There are three types of Steam community groups, each with different membership rules.\n[list]  [*][b]Public group[/b] \u2013 Users can join on their own or via an invite from a friend.[/*]  [*][b]Restricted group[/b] \u2013 Users can join by requesting membership. They can also receive an invite from a user that has permission to add members.[/*]  [*][b]Closed group[/b] \u2013 This is the most restricted group. Users can only join via invites. Users cannot request to join these groups.[/*]  [/list]    \n[h3]How to change these settings?[/h3]\n[list]  \t\n[*]Login to your Steam account.[*]Hover over your Profile name next to Community and select [i]GROUPS[/i] from the drop down.\n[*]Click the [i]Visit admin page[/i] link next to the group you wish to edit.\n[*]Select the [i]Edit group permissions[/i] tab and click the circle next to the desired Group Type to change it.[/list]     \n[h3]Inviting Members[/h3]You can invite friends to your group directly from their Steam community profile.
