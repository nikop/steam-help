Team Fortress 2 - Free to Play

What do I need to know about Team Fortress 2 Free to Play?

[h2]For new players:[/h2][b]Q. Who has a free account?[/b]

Anyone who has downloaded the game for free and has not made a purchase in the in-game Mann Co. Store has a free account.

[b]Q. Who has a premium account?[/b]

If you've ever spent money on Team Fortress 2, you have a premium account. This includes purchasing the game before it was Free-To-Play, receiving the game as a gift that was purchased, activating a retail version, or making a purchase in the Mann Co. in-game store.

[b]Q. How is a free account different than a premium account?[/b]

Premium accounts have a few extra features including access to rare and cosmetic items through random item drops, 300 backpack slots to start compared to 50 for free accounts, and more powerful trading and crafting abilities. Otherwise, however, the gameplay experience will be identical for both accounts.

We're increasing our focus on making sure that hostile players can't ruin your fun. Specifically, we'll be keeping a close eye on players exploiting the ability to make infinite free accounts to bypass bans. We've built systems that'll allow us to measure and track what these players are doing, and respond quickly.

It doesn't. You can keep enjoying Team Fortress 2 as you have before, with all the features and content you've come to expect from Team Fortress 2.

To thank you for your years of support we will be giving players who have purchased Team Fortress 2 a special Proof of Purchase hat to wear on any character in-game.

If a new player on a free account upgrades to a premium account and indicates that you were their most helpful friend, you will receive a special pair of glasses. Helping new users via the Coaching feature is a great way to meet new players and help them out!
