[h4]Can I play on my computer and the Samsung Steam Link application simultaneously?[/h4]Similar to the Steam Link device, you can control games from either the Link application or your host computer, but not both at once.

[h4]Can the Link application play games my computer can’t?[/h4]The role of the Link application is to stream content from your computer to a TV using the same technology as Steam Remote Play. Your games will not play any better than they already do on your computer.

[h4]How do I use the Steam Controller with the app?[/h4]Make sure the Steam Controller is paired to the wireless receiver before attempting to use the controller with the Link application using the instructions below:
[olist]
[*]Turn your Steam Controller off and launch Big Picture Mode with your mouse and keyboard. [/*]
[*]Plug the wireless receiver into your host computer. [/*]
[*]While in Big Picture Mode, select the ‘Settings’ icon from the top right section of the client. [/*]
[*]From here, select the ‘Controller’ menu. [/*]
[*]Then select 'Add Steam Controller’ and follow the on-screen pairing instructions [/*]
[*]Once paired, plug the wireless receiver into the Samsung TV to navigate the Steam Link application. [/*]
[/olist]
[h4]Does the Steam Link app support connecting to a PIN secured host computer?[/h4]No, in order to connect you'll need to remove the PIN by clicking on "Set Security Code" on the Remote Play settings on the remote computer, leaving the PIN blank, and clicking OK.
