-----------------------------------------

To configure multiple clients to play from behind the same router, you may need to change one of the clients to use a different clientport number.
[list]
[*]Each machine must have a unique Steam account with different game licenses registered to the account.
[*]Each machine must have a different clientport setting.
[*]Each machine must have a unique Mac address.
[*]The router must be up-to-date.
[*]Your Firewall and router must have the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/669A-2F68-D1D1-A5EC]required ports for Steam open[/url].
[/list]
The default clientport is [b]27005[/b] and you can only have one game with that port active on the same lan.


[h1]Specifying a Clientport as a Launch Option[/h1]
To specify a client port, please perform the following steps for each computer on the LAN
[list]
[*]Go to Steam's [b]Library[/b] menu
[*]Right-click on the game you wish to play
[*]Go to [b]Properties...[/b]
[*]From the [b]General[/b] tab, under [b]Launch Options[/b] you enter the launch option
[*]Add a different client port number on each machine between 27005 and 27032 in the following format:
[code]+clientport 270XX[/code]
[b]Note:[/b] Do not use 27020
[*]Leave the menu and launch the game
[/list]
[b]NOTE:[/b] This solution only works if you launch the game through the Steam client.

If you have already set other launch options, leave a space between the last character of your previous launch option and the [b]+[/b] of your clientport setting.


[h1]Specifying a Clientport in the userconfig.cfg[/h1]
The benefit of this method is that the clientport will remain set whether you are launching the game from the [b]My games[/b] menu or from a shortcut to the game.
[list]
[*]Navigate to the folder that holds the [b]config.cfg[/b] for your game
[b]Example:[/b] The config.cfg for Counter-Strike: Source can be found here:
[b]..\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\cfg[/b]
[*]If you have a [b]userconfig.cfg[/b] in that directory, open it. If you do not already have a userconfig.cfg:
[olist]
[*]Right-click in the folder
[*]Go to: [b]New[/b] > [b]Text Document[/b]
[*]Rename the file [code]userconfig.cfg[/code]
[*]Open the file with Notepad
[/olist]
[*]Type into the document [code]clientport 270XX[/code] where [b]XX[/b] are the last two digits of the clientport number. Acceptable values include 05 - 19 and 21 - 32
[*]Save your [b]userconfig.cfg[/b]
[*]Launch your game
