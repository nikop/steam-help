Valve will, upon request via [url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url], issue a refund for any title that is requested within 14 days of purchase and has been played for less than 2 hours. Even if you fall outside of the refund rules we've described, you can submit a request and we'll take a look at it.
Additional information and troubleshooting instructions for existing refund requests can be found in our [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5FDE-BA65-ACCE-A411]Common Refund Questions[/url] FAQ.
