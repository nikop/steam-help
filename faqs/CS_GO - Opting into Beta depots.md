# CS:GO - Opting into Beta depots

CS:GO Beta depots allow the game's developers (and users) to test changes not yet available in the Public version of the game.  
  
When opting into a beta depot players will be required to download updated files. The download size will vary based on the number of changes. Please note official Valve-matchmaking is not available in beta depots.  
  
To opt into beta depots:  

* Open the Steam client and navigate to your **Library**.
* From the CS:GO page, open the **Properties** window from the **Manage menu**.
* Select the **Betas** tab.
* Select the beta you would like to opt into.
* Launch CS:GO to play the game with its Beta changes.

To opt out of the beta and resume playing the current version of the game, select 'None' in the drop down on the betas tab. This will require you to re-download the current public files.
