* Make sure your items conform to the texture and triangle budgets and other technical requirements described in the [Hero Reference](http://www.dota2.com/workshop/requirements) pages and [Asset Creation Guidelines](http://www.dota2.com/workshop/#creation).
  ## 
## LAUNCH ITEM TOOLS
* Launch Dota 2 in Steam and click the button that says "Launch Dota 2 - Tools"

## ​[url id=itemtype][/url]
## SELECT ITEM TYPE
* In the "What are you publishing?" page, select the item type you wish to submit.
* "Hero Item..." will contain drop-down lists where you can choose a hero and an item slot (including ability models)
* "Images..." will contain a drop down list where you can choose Loading Screen, Team Logo, Emoticons, or Cursor Pack.
* "Contract Only" is used if Valve has contacted you or if you are submitting a [League ticket](https://support.steampowered.com/kb/1719-OPHL-1139/dota-2-league-tickets). It is not used for submitting items.

## 
## SELECT INPUTS
* Inputs will vary according to the item type.
* To fill most of these fields you'll browse to your model, texture, animation, image, or music files.
  
  
![http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/select_inputs.JPG?](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/select_inputs.JPG?)​  
  
# 
# INPUT ATTACHMENTS
* Details about typical creature attachments can be found on the [Ability Model](https://support.steampowered.com/kb/7823-RUAZ-5739/dota-2-workshop-ability-models-summoned-units#attachments) and [Courier](https://support.steampowered.com/kb/8986-WRAZ-1046/dota-2-workshop-couriers#attachments) pages.
* Other attachment needs will vary per item and will be described in the workshop tool.
* Ability models that can use Valve's default skeleton will have the default attach bone names automatically filled in.
* Some hero wearables that use default Valve particles, such as bow weapons, may have the joint bones automatically filled in since these will use the default skeleton.
* For custom skeletons you'll need to type in the exact names of attach bones (typically the head, hands and root for creatures), so make a note of these before starting your submission.​
* You will have the chance to reposition these attaches in the preview window after you compile your item.

## ​SAVE YOUR SESSION
* It's highly recommended that you save your workshop session by clicking the button in the upper left after filling in the inputs to avoid having to add this information again if you have to revise or restart your submission.
  
  
![http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/save_session.jpg](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/save_session.jpg)  
  
## ​
## COMPILE YOUR ITEM
* After saving the session, click "Next" in the lower right to compile the item.
  
![http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/next_button.jpg](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/next_button.jpg)​  
  
## IMPORT LOG
* This log text shows the compile processes and results for your model.
* If you encounter problems with your model compile, look at the Import Log to find errors. Sometimes a model compile error occurs because of a texture problem.

* Click "Next" after a successful compile.
  ## 
## PREVIEW MODEL
* ​You'll see your compiled model in the tool's model viewer.
* Ensure that NPCs are oriented  facing forward and upright for the bind pose because incorrect orientation can affect hitbox placement.
  
  
![http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/orientation_incorrect.jpg?](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/orientation_incorrect.jpg?)  ![http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/orientation_correct.jpg](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/orientation_correct.jpg)  
  
* Ensure that models for some hero items that become projectiles during abilities, such as thrown weapons for Pudge, Huskar and Enchantress, match the bind pose orientation of the hero's default weapon.

# PREVIEW SETTINGS
* You can click the gear icon to hide the model viewer's grid or change the background colors if you wish to use this pane for image captures.
* To see your items reacting to different animations, select these from the animation sequence drop down list.
* Select "Show Low-Res Model" to test the LOD 1 mesh as well as the LOD 0 mesh against important animations.

# 
# EDIT ATTACHMENTS
* To edit the position and orientation of attachments:
* Click "Edit Origin" or "Edit Angles".
* This will activate the attach dropdown list you can use to select which attachment you will be editing.
* Use the controls in the viewport to move or rotate your attachment.
* Save your session again to preserve these settings.

# MODEL TROUBLESHOOTING
* If your model's mesh is disconnected or the weighting is distorted, please see [this section](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5D5F-A5BD-C25B-7205#refmodel) of our Item Troubleshooting page.
  ## 
## PREVIEW IN GAME
* Some items have special requirements for testing. These may be noted in the submission tool, on the resource page for that hero or in the web guidelines for that item type.
* The workshop tool will allow you to test in-progress items that are initially overbudget or that are missing textures. This will help you easily see items in game early in the creation process in order to discover model or size problems when it's easier to make changes. You will need to adjust the model and textures to be within the item budget requirements before you can do the final submission to the workshop.
* There are now options to use the Demo Mode buttons for Refresh, Level Up and more in the workshop tool when testing items in game along with these workshop-specific options:
* "Toggle Day/Night" - useful for testing items in different lighting. You can also type dota_daynightcycle_toggle in the game console.
  
  
![http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/workshop_toggle_render.jpg](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/workshop_toggle_render.jpg)​  
  
* "Hero Display Mode" - this will cycle the test models through a variety of render display modes. This render display will carry through to the tool's model preview window. "Desaturated" is particularly valuable for assessing texture values in game. You can also display desaturated textures by typing r_hero_debug_render_mode 5 in the game console.

* Remember - your item's appearance from above in game view is just as important as its closeup appearance in loadout.
* Click "Next" when done testing.
  ## 
## EDIT PORTRAIT
* If you are submitting a courier, ward, or hero ability model, you will need to create a portrait for it.
* These item types should start with the default item's portrait as a template. You can either keep this or create a custom portrait.
* If there are portrait animations, select the "ACT_DOTA_CAPTURE" animation activity to ensure correct framing.
* If your courier, ward or ability model uses its in-game idle for its portrait but is moving too much to stay in the frame, you may need to create a custom portrait animation with reduced movement.
* Hero mounts are considered part of the hero and don't have their own portrait.
* Save your session again after creating a portrait - this will retain the portrait settings for future revisions.

## 
## MAKE REVISIONS
* You don't have to submit your first pass of an item to the workshop. You can take it as far as compiling the model in the tool and previewing it in game, then save your session, and exit the tool to do more work before making your final submission.
* To reload an existing session for an item you haven't submitted yet, return to the first page, click "Create New Item" and then, on the following page, click "Load Session" in the lower left.
  ## 
## SUBMIT YOUR ITEM TO THE STEAM WORKSHOP
* ​Once you are done previewing and revising your item, continue clicking "Next" to take the item through to the final workshop submission.
* Once the item is submitted to the Steam workshop, finalize the revenue shares.
* Save your final workshop session.
* If you have problems submitting your item, see our [Item Troubleshooting page](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5D5F-A5BD-C25B-7205).
  ## 
## ITEM COLLECTIONS 
* You can put all items for a hero's item set or other combinations of items (such as a courier and loading screen) into a collection on the workshop by going to the [Browsing: Collections](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=570&browsesort=trend&section=collections) part of the Steam Dota Workshop, clicking "Create Collection" , choosing the correct collection type and following the instructions.
  
  
![http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/create_collection.JPG](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/submission/create_collection.JPG)  
  
* NOTE: By default the middle collection type option is selected. For most Dota collections, you will need to select the top option, "Items that are a set". If you don't select this option, your collection may not display in some of the workshop searches our economy team uses and community votes may not be applied to the items within your collection.

## 
## UPDATING WORKSHOP SUBMISSIONS
* ​​If you need to update your item once it has been submitted to the workshop, you can select it from your list of submitted items in the tool's Workshop Manager and use the "Edit" menu to edit or re-upload your item.
* ​Unless you need to change payment shares or are submitting alternate versions of your submissions, it's best to keep updating the same workshop submission rather than doing a new submission every time there's a revision. This is less confusing for the community members who are viewing and voting for the items and for the Valve developers who are tracking submissions.
* If you need to change the payment shares of an item, you will need to do a new, separate workshop submission.
* If you would like to show your appreciation of a pre-approved Dota Workshop [Service Provider](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=570#service_providers), you have the option to give them a percentage of Valve's revenue if the items are sold on the Dota store.
