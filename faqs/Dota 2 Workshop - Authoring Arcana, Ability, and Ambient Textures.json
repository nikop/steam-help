It must use the Valve\u0027s default detail map for that hero.[/*]  \t[*]The strength or subtlety of the hues in an artist\u0027s color texture and the values in an artist\u0027s detail mask determine how vigorously the Arcana, ability, or ambient textures will display on their items.[/*]  \t[*]Valve artists have sometimes added detail masks to workshop items to help them display Arcana textures but moving forward we prefer that the community artists have the awareness of this need and provide the detail masks themselves. [/*]  \t[*]The item workshop submission tool is not currently able to let artists activate arcana textures on their items, but they will be able to preview ability and ambient textures.[/*]  \t[*]The links below will explain detail mask options for several heroes and Arcanas. Not all applicable heroes or items are covered but these examples should give an idea of practices that can be used in other situations.

It is up to community artists to decide how much base item color or white is to remain when an Arcana or gem color is active and author the color and detail masks accordingly.[/*]  \t[*]The default detail map used for Terrorblade is white and grey to allow Arcanas, gems, and Terrorblade\u0027s default blue-green ambient to provide different colorings.[/*]  \t[*]All Terrorblade workshop items with detail masks will use this default scrolling detail map.[/*]  [/list]\n\nTerrorblade default detail map, weapon color, detail mask, and model display. \n\nDark and desaturated color combined with a high contrast detail mask creates one strong outline that will cleanly display the Arcana colors and scrolling textures beneath the Arcana particles. The image on the right shows both the blue (default) and red (Arcana) coloring and scrolling texture applied to the detail mask areas.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/963303f5885c0239d5318c9568ef0d680e5fdfef.png[/img]\n\nTerrorblade default detail map, head color, detail mask, and model display. \n\nEven though the head item is replaced for the Arcana, the default head item still uses a detail mask to display the default ambient scrolling texture on the horns when the arcana is not equipped. Strong greenish coloring is retained from the color texture.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/32b32dc854f7747f30dfc80d2659378852cf96e0.png[/img]\n\nTerrorblade default detail map, demon color, detail mask, and game display. \n\nThe demon\u0027s very dark and desaturated color texture is designed to totally take its color from the Arcana, gems, or Terrorblade\u0027s default blue-green ambient. Combined with a detail mask that has small, fine details in a mix of strong and soft values means there will be a variety of added color and scrolling textures all over the demon\u0027s body.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/4ed404b384b6fd501ecf0f281d24a3cc6a9b958c.png[/img]\n\n[hr][/hr]  [h2] [/h2][h2][url id=legion][/url][/h2][h2]Legion Commander - \u0022Blades of Voth Domosh\u0022 Arcana[/h2][list]  \t[*]This Arcana uses Legion Commander\u0027s weapon slot, changing from single weapon to dual wield swords.[/*]  \t[*]Because of this, there\u0027s no need to add an Arcana detail mask to a custom Legion Commander spear - it will never be used with the Arcana.[/*]  \t[*]Some of Legion Commander\u0027s default items have detail masks to pick up the Arcana texture when that item is equipped.
