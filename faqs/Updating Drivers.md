# Updating Drivers

Using outdated drivers can affect performance despite video hardware meeting or exceeding the system requirements of the game you are playing. We recommend checking for driver updates on a regular basis. If you do encounter performance issues, updating your drivers is a good first step in troubleshooting.  
  
## Where To Update Your Drivers
For most graphics cards, you will be able to easily download and install the latest drivers from NVIDIA or AMD:  

* NVIDIA - [https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
* AMD - [https://www.amd.com/support](https://www.amd.com/support)

  
Use your Operating System, video card name & manufacturer, and driver version information to search your video card or computer manufacturer's site for updated drivers which will be compatible with your system.
