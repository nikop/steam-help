###  **What is Big Picture mode?**
Big Picture is a mode of Steam designed for use with your TV and game controller, so you can enjoy your Steam games from the comfort of your couch. With the press of a button, Steam displays a full-screen user interface which has been completely redesigned for readability and interaction on TV. It can also be used on your usual computer display.  
  
  
  
### **What platforms does Big Picture mode support?**
Big Picture is currently available on any PC running Windows 7 or newer, any Mac running macOS 10.11 or later, and Linux machines using up to date versions of Ubuntu. Please [click here](http://store.steampowered.com/bigpicture) for a full list of system requirements.  
  
On the Mac, a third-party driver must be used to enable the Xbox 360 controller. A driver is available from [TattieBogle.net](http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver).
