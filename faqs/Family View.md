# Family View
Updated 2022-02-20 09.00.38

Family View is a feature for parents and families to establish their own rules for what components of Steam are accessible.  
  
You can use Family View to limit an account's access to a subset of its content and features. With Family View, access to the Steam Store, Library, Community, Friends content and other features may be gated by the entry of a secret PIN.

We encourage you to create a Steam account with your child. If there are features of Steam that you would like to exclude from the experience, you can restrict access using Family View. You may also choose to enable Family View on your own Steam account if you would rather they share your Steam Account.   
If you are currently logged in to the Steam account for which you want to set up Family View, you can simply click [here ](https://store.steampowered.com/parental/set)to start the family view setup wizard. Otherwise, please follow these steps in the Steam Client or on the Steam website:   
  
## To enable Family View in the Steam Client:

# Family Games Library
If you’ve opted to only allow access to a subset of the account’s library, your account’s library will include a new group called Family Games. Family Games are the games you’ve chosen to remain accessible while in Family View.  
In order to add and remove games from this list you first need to disable Family View:  

* Log into the account.
* Select the Family View icon.
* Enter your Family View PIN to exit Family View.

  
Then, you can authorize the game with one of two methods:  

* Find the game in your Library and right-click on the game and click, then Manage > "Add to / Remove from Family Games".
* Visit the Family tab within Settings and click "Manage Family View" to run through the Family View wizard again. This will provide the option to add or remove games from your Family Games group. Once finished, to return to Family View select the Family View icon and confirm your choice.
