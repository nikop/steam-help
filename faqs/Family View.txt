Family View is a feature for parents and families to establish their own rules for what components of Steam are accessible.
You can use Family View to limit an account's access to a subset of its content and features. With Family View, access to the Steam Store, Library, Community, Friends content and other features may be gated by the entry of a secret PIN.

[url id=setitup][/url]  [h1]Setting up Family View[/h1]We encourage you to create a Steam account with your child. If there are features of Steam that you would like to exclude from the experience, you can restrict access using Family View. You may also choose to enable Family View on your own Steam account if you would rather they share your Steam Account.
If you are currently logged in to the Steam account for which you want to set up Family View, you can simply click [url=https://store.steampowered.com/parental/set]here [/url]to start the family view setup wizard. Otherwise, please follow these steps in the Steam Client or on the Steam website:
