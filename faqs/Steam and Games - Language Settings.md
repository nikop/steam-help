# Steam and Games - Language Settings
Updated 2021-08-10 16.32.49

How can I change the language for Steam and my games?  
  
#### Changing the language of the Steam client
The Steam language setting determines which language the Steam client application displays, as well as the language which games are presented in. (Third-party titles may have their own language settings - these settings will generally be independent of the Steam language setting)  
  

* Log into your Steam account
* Click on "**Steam"** in the top menu bar (this is in the very upper left of Steam on Windows, or in the menu bar above Steam on OSX)
* Go to the **Settings** option ("Preferences on" OSX)
* Go to the **Interface** tab
* Select the language you wish to use from the drop-down menu
* Click **OK** and then select the option to **Restart Steam**
* Once Steam restarts, you will be able to use Steam and Valve games in the language which you selected.
* If you have games installed that support the language you have selected, files for that language may need to be downloaded before you can play.

  
  
#### Changing the language of individual games
The language of many games can be changed independently from the Steam client language.  
  

* Open your Steam Library
* Right click the game title and select **Properties...**.
* Go to the **Language** tab
* Select the language you wish to use from the drop-down menu
* If the game supports the language you have selected, files for that language may need to be downloaded before you can play.

  
If you are experiencing problems enabling a language, make sure your desired language is selected in both locations.
