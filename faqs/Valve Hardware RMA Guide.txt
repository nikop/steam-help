If you are not satisfied with your Valve Hardware ("Hardware") purchase, you can pursue a refund or request product service. To make this as easy as possible for you, please use the "Return Merchandise Authorization" (RMA) process. You can start this process by contacting Steam Support [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware]here[/url].

Warranty Repairs or Replacement
[/h2]
If you are seeking repairs or replacement under Valve's [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4E41-6123-79EF-25BA]Limited Warranty[/url] (the “Warranty”), you must notify Valve of your warranty claim via the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware]Help Site[/url] and satisfy all other applicable terms and restrictions set forth in the Warranty terms.
Hardware must be transported or shipped to a Valve-designated service center in either the original packaging or in equally protective packaging. Provided the Hardware requires repair or replacement and such repair or replacement is covered by the Warranty or by your statutory rights under applicable laws, Valve will be responsible for the costs of shipping repaired or replacement Hardware back to you. If the Hardware does not require repair or replacement, you may be responsible for the costs of shipping the Hardware back to you. If you send your Hardware, but do not include all components or requested information, it could delay the length of your product service and you may incur additional shipping costs to send additional components or information so that Valve's requirements are satisfied.
If the Hardware does require repair or replacement, but the Warranty or statutory rights to receive repair or replacement do not apply (e.g., due to misuse), Valve will contact you regarding your options and their associated costs and options for payment, which may including the costs of shipping the Hardware back to you. Valve will not return Hardware that is shipped to Valve without pre-authorization or return any part or Hardware that is replaced pursuant to the Warranty.
