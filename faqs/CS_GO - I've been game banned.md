  ## Why are game bans issued?
Game bans in CS:GO are issued when a player attempts to circumvent or interfere with game systems to the detriment of others.  
  
Examples include:
* Cheating.
* Manipulation of matchmaking rank by deranking or falsely increasing your Skill Group.
* Botting and/or automation.
* Intentionally interfering with the normal operation of game servers or other players.

Game Bans for all of the above are not removed by Steam Support.  
  ## Can you tell me why I was game banned?

Whether you were using cheat software or automating matchmaking, the reason a game ban was issued is not shared with users.    
  ## Can I appeal my game ban?

  ## I was not using my account when it was game banned. Can the ban be removed?
