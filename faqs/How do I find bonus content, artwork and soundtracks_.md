Updated 2022-04-21 20.54.17

How do I find the following content that comes with my purchase?  

* Digital Artwork
* Soundtracks
* Digital Deluxe Content
* Other/Misc Content

  
All [Downloadable Content (DLC)](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6948-51E6-E624-8A84) access should automatically be added to the product. Please contact the product's support for assistance with DLC content.  
  
# In most cases, bonus content can be found within the products's downloaded files:
  
To access this content please do the following...  

* Right click the product in your Steam Library and select "Properties".
* Under the "Local Files" tab, select "Browse...".
* Within the product's local files, locate a folder that has a similar name to the content you are searching for.

  
Please note, the folder containing the bonus material may have a different title, but should be identifiable as the location for this content. All Soundtracks should be in MP3 format, while Art Books should be a PDF or ePub.  
  
  
# Where can I find Soundtracks within Steam?
  
Some soundtracks are automatically integrated into the Steam Music Player after the associated product has been completely installed. Please visit our [Steam Music Library and Player](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4DBA-E6A9-1115-7852) FAQ for more info. Soundtracks that are not automatically added can be found using the instructions above.
