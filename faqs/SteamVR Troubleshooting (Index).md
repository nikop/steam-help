 # Problems with your play area
#### My virtual position is different than my actual position
These issues are usually a result of tracking problems. Follow [these steps](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1AF1-670B-FF5C-3323#tracking) to resolve the issue.  
  
#### The orientation of my play area is not correct
If the position of your virtual floor or the "front" of your virtual space is incorrect, you can run Room Setup from the SteamVR menu.  
  
You can also change orientation and other features through advanced setting in room setup.

# Common Issues
#### Headset is not connecting or loses connection
Check all of your headset's connections. If you see any of the messages below, securing loose cables and restarting the heaset (SteamVR menu > *Devices.* *Restart headset*) can resolve the issue.  
  
[*]**Headset Display Disconnected**[/*]  				[*]**Headset not Detected**[/*]  				[*]**Laptop: Headset Display Disconnected**[/*]  
#### SteamVR fails to start, quits unexpectedly or is unresponsive
Start by performing all the steps from the General Troubleshooting section above. If your problem persists, you can try running SteamVR in safe mode:  
  
[*]Type "run" into the Windows search bar.[/*]  			[*]Type "vrmonitor://safemode/enable" into the Run window.[/*]  			[*]You can exit safe mode at any time from the dialog above the SteamVR status window.[/*]  
If safe mode has not resolved your issue, click "Contact Steam Support" below to get help.  
  
#### SteamVR Safe Mode
SteamVR's safe mode prevents the loading of some third party drivers and other components that can cause problems. If safe mode resolves your issue, it is likely that you have installed something that is interfering with SteamVR. For example, some VR "utility" applications such as Natural Locomotion and LIV are known to conflict with SteamVR in some cases.
