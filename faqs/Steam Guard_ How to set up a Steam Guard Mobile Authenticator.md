Next you'll enter a phone number, one that we can confirm with a text message. If you ever lose access to your Steam account, you can quickly recover it by asking Steam to send a text to this phone number.  
  
Enter your phone number. Add the international prefix from the drop down.

Enter the code we've sent to that phone number. If you didn't receive the text, you resend it using the link at the bottom of the screen. Note: Depending on your carrier, messages can be temporarily delayed. If you don't receive the text after a few hours, please contact Steam Support for additional assistance.
