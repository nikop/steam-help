The apps follow the same setup flow. For the purposes of this walkthrough, the images below show the iOS app.  
  
Once you've installed the app and signed in with your Steam account credentials, you'll land on the Steam Guard tab. From here you can select "Add authenticator" to setup your authenticator.  
  
![{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39983882/c80555d76bb109e1aa5ebdd0e65d84d312263eea.png]({STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39983882/c80555d76bb109e1aa5ebdd0e65d84d312263eea.png)  
  
Next you'll enter a phone number, one that we can confirm with a text message. If you ever lose access to your Steam account, you can quickly recover it by asking Steam to send a text to this phone number.  
  
Enter your phone number. Add the international prefix from the drop down.  
  
![{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39983882/6b4f8493ea9fc250363d377e187c6b0f80dfc30c.png]({STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39983882/6b4f8493ea9fc250363d377e187c6b0f80dfc30c.png)  
  
Steam will send a confirmation code to your phone.  
  
![{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39983882/65f58f5cf33a5fe23bd247b2326ced526e324d64.png]({STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39983882/65f58f5cf33a5fe23bd247b2326ced526e324d64.png)  
  
Enter the code we've sent to that phone number. If you didn't receive the text, you resend it. Note: Depending on your carrier, messages can be temporarily delayed. If you don't receive the text after a few hours, please contact Steam Support for additional assistance.

When the code is successfully entered, we'll present you with a Recovery code. Write down the code and store it in a safe place. This code allows you to recover your account yourself, should you lose your phone or authenticator. Do not skip this step.

When the mobile authenticator is successfully enabled, you'll have three options for confirming your Steam sign ins.   
  
1 - Use the mobile app to scan the QR code presented by Steam at sign in  
2 - Enter your name and password, then Steam will send you an app notification asking you to confirm  
3 - Enter your name and password, then enter the Steam Guard code from the mobile app  
  
  
## Protecting multiple accounts
Your Steam Mobile app can be used to authenticate multiple Steam accounts. From the blue drop down on the Steam Guard tab, select an account or add a new one. Follow the steps above to add the mobile authenticator to this account. When that's successfully completed, you'll be able to confirm sign ins for all of your accounts, regardless of which  account is signed into the app.
