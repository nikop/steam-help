Steam Link Hardware

[img]https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_link/SteamLink_Support_Header01.png[/img]     [h1]Steam Link Hardware[/h1]The Steam Link allows you to stream games from the Steam Library on your PC to any TV in your home. The technology takes advantage of the horsepower you already have in your home, streaming from your current gaming computer by mirroring its experience to your TV.

Video and audio data is sent from your computer, while your controller input is sent back in real time. Virtually every game that your computer runs can be streamed with the Steam Link.

[expand type=title title="Frequently Asked Questions"]    [h4]Why is my Steam Link unable to find my host computer?[/h4]There are a number of factors that can cause this issue, please try the following steps:

[olist]  				[*]Make sure you are on the same home network and that Steam is running[/*]  				[*]Enable streaming from the Remote Play settings menu in the Steam client[/*]  				[*]If possible, connect all devices directly to the router with an Ethernet cable[/*]  			[/olist]

[h4]Why can’t I connect to my host computer?[/h4]One of the most common causes for this issue is interfering software, such as a firewall or anti-virus software. Please review the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1F39-DCB4-FF28-5748]Programs Which May Interfere with Steam[/url] article.

Alternatively, from the Steam Link main menu, highlight your host computer, then press the "Y" button to start the network test. This test will start Big Picture on your host computer and simulate 10 seconds of network traffic with your current network settings.

The test will also inform you if there are any issues with ports. If you see any errors, make sure your [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/2EA8-4D75-DA21-31EB]ports are appropriately configured for Steam.[/url]

[h4]The game is choppy and unresponsive. How can I improve the experience?[/h4]We recommend using wired connection for best experience. For wireless connection, the majority of people have found that switching to a 5GHz network significantly improves the gaming experience.

Alternatively, you can switch to the ‘Fast’ streaming quality option from the Streaming settings in the Steam Link.

[h4]How can I pair multiple controllers to my Steam Link?[/h4]You can pair a Steam Controller to your wireless receiver or directly to the Steam Link. To pair a Steam Controller directly to the Link, remove all USB peripherals from the Steam Link, boot to the blue pairing screen, and power-on the Steam Controller by holding "X" with the Steam/Home button. You can repeat these steps for pairing additional controllers.

To toggle between pairing modes (the wireless receiver or Steam Link), press the Steam button while holding "A".

[h4]How can I play non-Steam games on the Steam Link?[/h4]The Steam Link can stream any computer game once you add it to your Steam library. Retail games and non-Steam games can be added to your Steam library from the Steam client by clicking "+ ADD A GAME" in the bottom left corner and then selecting “Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library...”. You should launch the game from Steam, rather than using a shortcut on your desktop.
