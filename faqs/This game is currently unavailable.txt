I see the error "[b]This game is currently unavailable"[/b] when launching a game through Steam.  What can I do?

[*]This error may be caused by having certain Steam files set to Read Only.  To resolve this:       
[list] 
[*] Exit Steam.

[/list][*] If this issue is only happening on a third party non-Valve game, please try launching the game's .exe directly from its installation folder: [b]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\<Game Title>[/b].  You may also try other .exe's such as Launcher.exe in the game folder to see if a different error message is found.      
[*] If the issue persists, it may be caused by a network configuration issue.  Please complete the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/669A-2F68-D1D1-A5EC]Troubleshooting Network Connectivity[/url] guide to further assess the problem.

[h1]Secondary Installers[/h1]
Many Steam games include installers for features and services required by the game. These include installers for DirectX, PhysX, Games for Windows Live, C++ components, or Windows updates required by the game.

Steam is designed to run these installers when the game is first launched. If an installer is canceled by a user or prevented from running by another application on your system, the game may not launch correctly.  If this occurs, these installers will need to be launched manually.

These installers are found in the game's installation folder, or a subfolder, found in the following location by default: [b]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\<Game Title>\[/b].
