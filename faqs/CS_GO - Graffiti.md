[section id=howgraffiti] ## How do I get in-game graffiti?
There are three ways players can get in-game graffiti:  

*  Players have a chance to receive graffiti as a free weekly drop for ranking up.
*  Graffiti Boxes featuring art created by Steam Community Artists can be purchased. A portion of the proceeds from sales of Community Graffiti Boxes is shared among the community artists.
*  Individual graffiti patterns can be purchased from the Steam Community Market.

[section id=graffititypes] ## How many different types of graffiti are there?
There are two different types of graffiti patterns; monochrome and multi-colored. Monochrome (one color) patterns are received as rank up drops and multi-colored patterns are received when purchasing a graffiti box. Both types of graffiti can be traded and sold on the Steam Community Market.[/section]   
[section id=graffitiuses] ## How many times can I use a graffiti pattern?
When a player unseals graffiti they can apply that pattern 50 times. Players who unseal a graffiti pattern they already have in their Inventory will receive 50 additional charges to their existing supply.[/section]   
[section id=graffittitime] ## How often can I apply graffiti?
Players can apply graffiti once per round, or every 45 seconds, whichever is shorter. Getting a kill in a round-based game mode will allow the player to apply more graffiti.[/section]   
[section id=graffitilength] ## How long does my graffiti last?
One application of graffiti lasts 7 minutes and degrades over time until it is no longer visible.[/section]   
[section id=graffitizone] ## Where can I apply graffiti?
The graffiti preview shows where and how the graffiti pattern will be applied. If there is no preview then the surface does not support graffiti.[/section]   
[section id=graffitinumber] ## How many different graffiti patterns can I have equipped at once?
Players can have as many different graffiti patterns equipped as they want and can use the in-game graffiti menu to select and apply a different graffiti pattern at every application.[/section]   
[section id=graffiticheck] ## How do I see my available graffiti?
All graffiti patterns can be viewed in players' inventories and in the in-game graffiti menu.[/section]   
[section id=graffitimarket] ## Can I sell and trade my graffiti?
Graffiti can be sold on the Steam Community Market and traded as long as it is sealed. Once a player has unsealed their graffiti it can not be traded or sold on the Steam Community Market.[/section]   
[section id=graffitidelete] ## Can I delete graffiti from my Inventory?
Yes, but the graffiti must be unsealed. Once you have unsealed the graffiti, locate the item in your CS:GO inventory, right click on it, then select 'Delete Item'.[/section]
