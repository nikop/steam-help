[h1]How do I receive extra copies to share with friends?[/h1]
[h3]
Extra copies will only be issued as a special promotion in the following specific cases:
[/h3]
[olist]
[*]Users who own "Half-Life 2" and go on to purchase "The Orange Box" will receive an extra copy of "Half-Life 2". [/*]
[*]Users who own "Half-Life 2: Episode One" and then go on to purchase the "The Orange Box" will receive an extra copy of "Half-Life 2: Episode One". [/*]
[*]Users who purchase the available four packs for specific Steam titles will receive three extra copies of that title to gift to friends. [/*]
[*]Extra copies may apply as a part of some limited time promotions. In that case, information on what will be included with your purchase will be listed on the storefront's transaction page. [/*]
[/olist]
These special promotions will allow you to send a gift pass for your extra copy to a friend who does not already own the game.
These promotion do not apply to any games other than those specifically listed.

[h1]Giving away extra copies[/h1]
[h3]
When will I be able to give away my extra copies?
[/h3]
Your extra copies will be available to give away once the game or game package has been registered to your Steam account.
[h3]
How do I know when I have extra copies available to give away?
[/h3]
You can always find any available extra copies on your account by clicking "Manage gifts & guest passes" under the "Games" menu in Steam. The extra copies will be listed in your Steam Inventory.
Furthermore, upon redeeming a bundle from your inventory when your account already owns one or more of the games you will receive a warning that explains which games you [b]will [/b]receive an extra copy for before you add the bundle to your Library.
[h3]
[b]Will my extra copies expire if I don't give them out quickly enough?[/b]
[/h3]
While some guest passes are temporary, the extra copies you receive for the promotions listed above will not expire – you can gift your extra copies at any time as long as your Steam account remains active.
[h3]
[b]What will my friend receive when I send them my extra copy?[/b]
[/h3]
Your extra copy will arrive as a gift message. If your friend does not currently have a Steam account or you see an error when sending it to a Steam account, please attempt to send the gift to your friend's email address.  You can read more about how to send and re-send gifts [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/2C02-3563-B72F-F117]here[/url].
[h3]
[b]How can I tell if my friend already owns one of these games?[/b]
[/h3]
If you are sending a gift directly through Steam, users who already own this game will automatically be filtered out of the potential list of recipients.
If you are positive that they do not have this game, you can send it to their email. Users who already have a subscription to a gift they’ve received will not be able to activate it on their existing account.
[h3]
[b]May I Buy or Sell my extra copies?[/b]
[/h3]
No. This violates the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/]Steam Subscriber Agreement[/url] and may result in all involved Steam accounts becoming permanently disabled.
