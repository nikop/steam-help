[*]Update your graphics drivers to the latest version. Refer to the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5799-495F-1F25-D15B]Updating Drivers article[/url] for more information. [/*]

Make sure there are no stairs or windows within your space and that you have cleared any obstacles from the play area—including pets!

[tr]    		[td][/td]  		[td]  	  		[h4]Set up your Index Base Stations[/h4]Make note of how high you are placing the base stations and keep in mind, that the base stations should always point toward the center of the play area. As an example, if you place a base station above your head height, you should tilt the base station down and toward the center of the play area. If you place it on a coffee table at knee height, you should tilt the base station upward and toward the center.

Plug each base station into an outlet and remove the protective film from the base station lenses. The front LED should be on and visible when powered.

For help mounting your Base Station, see the section below.
