Enabling VAC security requires a different process for the different types of dedicated servers.  
  
#### Steam Dedicated Servers
The process for enabling VAC security is the same for **Steam Half-Life Dedicated Servers** and **Steam Source Dedicated Servers**.  
  
* Launch your Steam Dedicated Server from the Steam **Tools** tab.
* Make sure the **Secure (Valve Anti-Cheat)** checkbox is checked.
* Start the server.
  
  
#### Standalone Dedicated Servers
VAC Security is enabled by default for Standalone Dedicated Servers. To turn VAC security **OFF** for your Standalone Dedicated server add *-insecure* to your launch switches.
