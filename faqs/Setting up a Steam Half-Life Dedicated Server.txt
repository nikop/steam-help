[/section]
To run the Steam Half-Life Dedicated Server you must first install Steam. To install Steam click the link below: [url=http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=getsteamnow]Download Steam[/url]

After installing Steam, you must create a Steam account to run your dedicated server. This is separate from the Steam account you normally use to play games. If you attempt to run a dedicated server from your normal Steam account, you will not be able to join your server using the same account.
