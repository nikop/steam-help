Surround Sound does not Function in Source Games
------------------------------------------------
Updated 2021-07-10 19.49.55

Source games rely on the operating system to identify the audio device for them. If your surround setup is not properly configured in Windows or is configured through a proprietary control panel, it may not be properly recognized by Source games.

[list]      [*]Ensure that your audio device is setup appropriately in your Windows Control Panel.[*]Launch the game and adjust your settings in the [b]Options > Audio[/b] menu.[/list]
If the issue persists, close any proprietary audio control applications and repeat the process.

You can also use one of the following launch options to test the issue:
