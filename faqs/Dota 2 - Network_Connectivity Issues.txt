I am unable to connect to the Dota 2 network, experiencing network lag in-game, or losing my connection to the Dota 2 servers while playing. What can I do?

[h3]Dota 2 server downtime[/h3]Periodically, the Dota 2 servers may need to be brought down temporarily for maintenance or updates. You do not need to report downtime during such outages.

[h3]Troubleshooting connectivity[/h3]If you are getting disconnected from Dota 2 across multiple games or with any regularity, this points to an issue with your connection to the Dota 2 or Steam network.
