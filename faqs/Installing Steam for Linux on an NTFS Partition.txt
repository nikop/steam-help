Installing Steam for Linux on an NTFS Partition

Commonly, drives are mounted automatically using [b]/etc/fstab[/b]. In order to install Steam for Linux onto an NTFS partition, it must be explicitly mounted using the [b]ntfs-3g[/b] driver. The following information lists the steps for properly modifying your [b]/etc/fstab[/b] file:

From a command-line, determine the UUID of the drive containing the NTFS partition:

[code]sudo blkid[/code]

Add a line to your [b]/etc/fstab[/b] file that mounts that drive with [b]ntfs-3g:[/b]

[code]UUID=[i]yourUUID  [/i]/data  ntfs-3g  defaults,locale=en_US.utf8  0 0[/code]

Save your changes and reboot your machine.
