[section id=whataretuc]
[h2]
What are Trade Up Contracts?
[/h2]
Trade Up Contracts allow players to trade 10 normal or StatTrak weapon skins of the same weapon grade (Mil-Spec to Classified) for one weapon skin of the next highest weapon grade from one of the weapon collections used in the trade up.

To use a Trade Up Contract, left-click on an eligible weapon and select 'Use With Trade Up Contract'.
[/section]
[section id=whatitemstuc]
[h2]
Which weapon skins can be used in Trade Up Contracts?
[/h2]
A Trade Up Contract requires all ten weapons to be the same weapon grade (Mil-Spec, Restricted, or Classified) and either normal or StatTrak. Normal weapon skins cannot be used in a Trade Up Contract with StatTrak weapon skins and vice versa.

To verify if a weapon can be used in a Trade Up Contract, hover over the weapon in your CS:GO Inventory and look for the Collection it's included in. If the weapon's grade is the highest in its Collection it can [i]not[/i] be used in a Trade Up Contract.

[b]Note:[/b] Covert (red) weapon skins can not be used in Trade Up Contracts.
[/section]
[section id=weaponwear]
[h2]
The skin I received isn't the weapon wear I'd like. Why is this?
[/h2]
Regardless of the weapon wear on the skins you're trading up, the weapon wear on the skin you receive will be randomized, meaning you may receive a Battle-Scarred skin even if you trade up all Factory New skins. This result is always randomized and cannot be controlled by trading up skins with a specific weapon wear.
[/section]
[section id=whatarent]
[h2]
What are Name Tags?
[/h2]
Name Tags in CS:GO are single use in-game items which allow players to nickname their weapons. Name Tags cannot be modified once they've been applied to a weapon.

To remove a Name Tag on an existing weapon, left-click on the weapon, select 'Rename', then 'Remove Name'.

Name Tags can be purchased for $1.99 USD in-game or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Community Market[/url].
[/section]
[section id=characters]
[h2]
What characters can I use on a Name Tag?
[/h2]
The following characters can be used on Name Tags:
[list]
[*]a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z [/*]
[*]A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [/*]
[*]0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [/*]
[*]`!@#$%^&*-+=(){}[]/|\,.?:;'_ (and "space", but Name Tags can't start with spaces) [/*]
[/list]
[b]Note:[/b] Any characters not listed here are not supported on Name Tags and may not display properly.
[/section]
[section id=tagposition]
[h2]
Can I change the position of the Name Tag on a weapon?
[/h2]
No. Name Tags have a pre-determined location on each weapon which cannot be changed.
[/section]
[section id=whatarestick]
[h2]
What are Stickers?
[/h2]
Stickers in CS:GO are single use in-game items that can be applied to one of four locations on each weapon.

Stickers can be scraped once they've been applied to a weapon to change their appearance. To do this, left-click on a weapon in your CS:GO Inventory which has Stickers, select 'Scrape Sticker', and click on the Sticker you'd like to scrape.

Stickers can be purchased through in-game offers or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Community Market[/url].

[b]Note:[/b] Scraping a Sticker cannot be undone - once you have clicked on a Sticker to scrape it the results are permanent.
[/section]
[section id=movesticker]
[h2]
I have applied a Sticker and would like to move it. Can I do this?
[/h2]
No. Once a Sticker has been placed on a weapon it cannot be moved. If you'd like to remove the Sticker you will need to scrape it in-game until the 'Remove Sticker' option appears.

[b]Note:[/b] Removing a Sticker from a weapon is permanent and the Sticker will not be returned to your Inventory.
[/section]
[section id=stickergone]
[h2]
Stickers on my weapon are not visible when I inspect in-game. Why is this?
[/h2]
Stickers on your weapon may not be visible because they've been heavily scraped. When Stickers are scraped they lose their vibrance and eventually won't be visible on the weapon when inspecting it. Stickers that have been heavily scraped will only leave an outline of the original sticker.

You're free to completely remove the sticker by scraping it further using the in-game UI.
[/section]
[section id=swaptool]
[h2]
What is a StatTrak Swap Tool?
[/h2]
StatTrak Swap Tools are single use items which allow players to transfer kill counts from one StatTrak weapon skin to another so long as the weapon is the same. Kills from a StatTrak M4A1-S can only be transferred to another StatTrak M4A1-S using a Swap Tool, [i]not[/i] to another weapon.

StatTrak Swap Tools can be purchased for $.99 USD in-game or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Community Market[/url].

Storage Units can be purchased in-game for $1.99.
[/section]
[section id=whoneedssu]

Who needs a Storage Unit?
[/h2]
Any user who wants to hold more than 1,000 items in their CS:GO Inventory will need a Storage Unit. Even if you have not reached the 1,000 item Inventory limit, Storage Units can be labeled and used as a way to more effectively organize your CS:GO Inventory.
[/section]
[section id=depositsu]
[h2]
How do I deposit items to a Storage Unit?
[/h2]
There are two ways to deposit items into a Storage Unit:
[list]
[*]Click on an item in your Inventory, select 'Move to Storage Unit', and select the Storage Unit you would like to move the item to. [/*]
[*]Click on the Storage Unit in your Inventory and select 'Deposit Items', then select which items you would like to add to the Storage Unit. [/*]

[section id=whereretrieve]
[h2]
I retrieved an item but can not find it in my Inventory. Where did it go?
[/h2]
When items are retrieved from a Storage Unit they are added back to your CS:GO Inventory in the same location they were prior to being deposited. Retrieved items will not appear at the top of your CS:GO Inventory.

If you can not find the retrieved item we suggest scrolling through your Inventory or searching for the item using 'Search Items'. It is not possible to lose items you are depositing or retrieving from Storage Units because they never leave your account.
[/section]
[section id=interactsu]
[h2]
How can I interact with items placed in a Storage Unit?
[/h2]
Any item in a Storage Unit cannot be equipped, consumed, traded, marketed, renamed, or altered until it is retrieved to your Inventory.
[/section]
[section id=tradesu]
[h2]
Can I trade or market items in a Storage Unit?
[/h2]
No, you would need to take the items out of the Storage Unit first. Storage Units are singular in purpose and only meant for holding items. Storage units with or without items cannot be traded, marketed, or deleted from an account.
[/section]
[section id=renamesu]
[h2]
How often can I rename a Storage Unit?
[/h2]
Storage Units can be renamed as often as you would like. To rename a Storage Unit click on it in your Inventory and select 'Change Label'.
