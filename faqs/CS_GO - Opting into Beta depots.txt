Version 5

CS:GO Beta depots allow the game's developers (and users) to test changes not yet available in the Public version of the game.

When opting into a beta depot players will be required to download updated files. The download size will vary based on the number of changes. Please note official Valve-matchmaking is not available in beta depots.

To opt into beta depots:

[olist]

[*]Open the Steam client and navigate to your [b]Library[/b]. [/*]

[*]From the CS:GO page, open the [b]Properties[/b] window from the [b]Manage menu[/b].
[*]Select the [b]Betas[/b] tab.
[*]Select the beta you would like to opt into.
[*]Launch CS:GO to play the game with its Beta changes. [/*]

[/olist]
To opt out of the beta and resume playing the current version of the game, select 'None' in the drop down on the betas tab. This will require you to re-download the current public files.
