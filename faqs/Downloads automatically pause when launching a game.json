  "content": "Why do downloads in Steam stop when I begin playing a game?\n\nSteam automatically pauses your downloads when a game is launched in order to prioritize the network activity for the game itself.\n\nYou can turn this feature off by navigating to your download settings: [i]Steam \u003E Settings \u003E Downloads[/i]. From here, check the [i]Allow Downloads During Gameplay[/i] box.\n\nIf the download is affecting the network performance of the game, you can also consider setting a bandwidth limit from the download settings.\n\n",
