The community artist only provides the weighted mesh.[/*]  \t\t[*]For ability models, the skeleton and animations are separate from the hero and may sometimes be custom tailored by community artists in addition to the mesh.[/*]  \t[/list]  \t[/*]  \t[*]Not all heroes use an ability model.

Ability models that currently require this are:    \t[list]  \t\t[*]Undying\u0027s Flesh Golem[/*]  \t\t[*]Lone Druid\u0027s True Form[/*]  \t\t[*]Dragon Knight\u0027s Elder Dragon[/*]  \t\t[*]Venomancer\u0027s Plague Wards[/*]  \t\t[*]Shadow Shaman\u0027s Serpent Wards[/*]  \t[/list]  \t[/*]  [/list]\n\n\u200B\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[url id=animguidelines][/url]\n\n[h2]ABILITY MODEL ANIMATION GUIDELINES[/h2][list]  \t[*]Attack - some units may have the option for several attack variations originating from both hands or from the mouth or tail.[/*]  \t[*]Aim - certain hero wards will need you to provide poses of them facing in several different directions. These are explained in the workshop tool.[/*]  \t[*]Ability - ability animations can show the units casting an ability, reacting to an ability or transforming into and out of the human form of the hero.[/*]  \t[*]Injured or other modifiers - These will be explained in the workshop submission tool. For injured attacks you can work from a copy of your regular attack animations and just make sure that they match their injured pose at the beginning and end.[/*]  \t[*]Turns - though optional, these right, left, and center poses are very helpful for generating smooth transitions during turns, especially for horizontal or long creatures that can otherwise look somewhat mechanical when turning.[/*]  \t[*]For general animation guidelines, see [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb/3634-YOPS-9967/dota-2-workshop-npc-animations]Workshop NPC Animation[/url][/*]  [/list]\n\n\u200B\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[url id=hitboxes][/url]\n\n[h2]HITBOXES[/h2][list]  \t[*]Hitbox creation by community artists is not currently supported for the Source 2 Dota Workshop. Hitboxes are created by Valve artists once a custom NPC is accepted for the game.[/*]  \t[*]Temporary generic hitboxes are created by the workshop tool when you test your model in demo mode so that it can be selectable. These are not the final hitboxes. [/*]  [/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]  [h2] [/h2][h2][url id=attachments][/url][/h2][h2]ATTACHMENT POINTS[/h2][list]  \t[*]An attachment is a static point bound to a bone in the skeleton. The names and number of attachments used varies with each type of NPC.[/*]  \t[*]You create these in the item workshop submission tool by naming the bones that these attaches will bind to. [/*]  \t[*]Some ability models that use Valve\u0027s default skeleton will have the default attach bone names automatically filled in.[/*]  \t[*]Once your model compiles you will have the option to adjust the attachment\u0027s position or orientation if necessary.[/*]  \t[*]Below are typical attachment points. These names are specific and case sensitive.  \t[list]  \t\t[*]attach_hitloc - This attachment is required for every NPC item. \u0022hitloc\u0022 stands for \u0022Hit Location\u0022 and is used by the particle system to determine where projectile effects should travel to when fired at your NPC. For most creatures, the best place for \u0022attach_hitloc\u0022 is a bone in the chest or head. Placing this attach in the root or on the ground results in projectiles traveling too low and is less appealing. For inorganic models, choose a location above the center of the model.[/*]  \t\t[*]attach_attack1 - This attachment is required for NPCs that can attack or cast spells.   \t\t[list]  \t\t\t[*]For units with ranged projectiles, this determines where projectiles will be created and launched from.[/*]  \t\t\t[*]For melee units, place the attachment in the hand the unit attacks with. You may be asked to place an additional attach_attack2 in the other hand, the mouth or the tail.[/*]  \t\t[/list]  \t\t[/*]  \t\t[*]attach_eye_l and attach_eye_r - These attachments are only used to apply Valve\u0027s default particles to some ability models. The workshop submission tool will say when these are required. Place these on the unit\u0027s eyes, making sure that the red X axis points in the direction the eye looks. [/*]  \t[/list]  \t[/*]  \t[*]Certain units, like Terrorblade\u0027s Demon or Warlock\u0027s Golem, may require additional attachments to position Valve\u0027s default particle effects. The workshop submission tool will explain these where needed.[/*]  \t[*]Details about designating and editing attachments in the workshop tool can be found on the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3E00-D38F-B793-7384]Submitting Items[/url] page.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[url id=testing][/url]\n\n[h2]ABILITY MODEL TESTING[/h2]When Valve artists review custom NPCs they are mainly evaluated on how they look from above in game view. To test your custom ability models in game, you may need to attain a certain hero level or trigger certain events to spawn the units. \n\n[list]  \t[*]You can now use the Demo Mode option buttons in the workshop tool.[/*]  \t[*]You can force a hero to level up by clicking the Level Up or Level to Max buttons or opening the game console and entering \u0022sv_cheats 1\u0022 and then using \u0022dota_dev hero_level \u003Cnumber\u003E\u0022 in the console or entering \u0022-lvlup \u003Cnumber\u003E\u0022 in the in-game chat.[/*]  \t[*]Clicking the Free Spells or Refresh buttons or entering the console command \u0022dota_ability_debug 1\u0022 will remove ability cooldowns so you can quickly recast spells.[/*]  \t[*]Most units can simply be spawned by clicking its ability icon or using the corresponding hotkey once your hero has attained the necessary level. [/*]  \t[*]Some units require a specific combination of levels, abilities or events to spawn:  \t[list]  \t\t[*]To spawn Invoker\u0027s Forged Spirit, you need to have 1 instance of Quas and 2 instances of Exort. Then you select the Invoke ability, which creates an option to spawn a Forged Spirit.[/*]  \t\t[*]To spawn Broodmother\u0027s Spiderlings, you need her Spawn Spiderlings Ultimate ability, then you need to cast this ability onto an enemy just before they die to spawn the Spiderlings.[/*]  \t\t[*]To test the different level colors of Dragon Knight\u0027s Elder Dragon, you will need to level up the hero incrementally. You can also view the different materials by using the \u0027Texture\u0027 drop-down in the Preview Model page of the workshop tool.[/*]  \t[/list]  \t[/*]  [/list]\n\n\u200B\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[url id=submitting][/url]\n\n[h2]SUBMITTING ABILITY MODELS [/h2][list]  \t[*]Refer to the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3E00-D38F-B793-7384]Submitting Items[/url] page for important general information about testing and submitting items.[/*]  \t[*]Ability models are submitted under the \u0022Hero Item\u0022 category.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[img]http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/ability_models/ability_submission.jpg[/img]\n\n[list]  \t[*]It is no longer necessary to maintain our file structure when preparing your item files.
