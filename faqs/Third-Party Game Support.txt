[list]  	[*]Any game developed by [b]Valve[/b] - including Blue Shift and Opposing Force. (Valve will appear in the [b]Developer[/b] field for the game on its Library page if you click the information button)[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/3c4b2e5172f93f66bedd3b83628a68f4e00bb06b.png[/img][/*]  	[*]Connecting to Steam or otherwise using a Steam account[/*]  	[*]The process of purchasing a game through Steam, such as payment issues[/*]  	[*]Registering a retail CD Key for a game on Steam[/*]  	[*]Any errors which prevent the game from starting and appear in a Steam dialog box[/*]  	[*]Any "Authentication" or "CD Key" related errors which appear after loading the game (These issues may be caused by a third party program or server and Steam Support may refer you to the correct support team) [/*]  [/list]

[h4]Games Developed and Supported by Third-party Developers/Publishers[/h4]You will need to contact the game's developer/publisher directly for support if you encounter any errors or unexpected behavior which is not related to Steam authentication or CD Keys after the game has loaded. If you are unable to locate third-party support, please contact Steam Support for further information. Some examples include:
[list]  	[*]Game crashes or errors after the game has been launched (that do not appear in a Steam dialog box)[/*]  	[*]Not being able to connect to multiplayer servers[/*]  	[*]Game bugs[/*]  	[*]Gameplay and/or controller questions[/*]  	[*]Third-party DRM and activation limits[/*]  [/list]
Sending your support request to Steam Support rather than the correct provider may result in a delay in processing your request. Please make sure that your question is only sent to Steam Support if it does not fall into the criteria listed above.
