Updated 2021-07-10 19.49.55

When launching a game, Steam displays an error message:  

* Failed to Start Game (Missing Executable)

  
  
This error is seen when a game file is missing or is being blocked by another program. Here are some troubleshooting steps to help resolve the error.  
  
## Troubleshooting Steps
  

* **Check your anti-virus software**  
This error is most commonly seen when your anti-virus software mistakenly reports game files as malicious and quarantines them.  
  
There are a couple of ways to resolve this:  
  

* within the anti-virus software look for game files that have been reported and mark them as safe
* set your anti-virus software to Game Mode
* have the anti-virus software exclude that game folder when it scans for malicious content. [Here's how to do that with popular anti-virus software](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5F3D-1477-AFF9-C4F3).

  
  
You should also temporarily uninstall any applications listed in our [Programs Which May Interfere with Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1F39-DCB4-FF28-5748).
* **Verify Game Files**  
If it's not caused by anti-virus software, the issue could be a corrupted file or failed download. To make sure you have all the files needed, restart your PC and then verify your game files. [You can easily do that from the game properties panel](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB).
* **Submit a Steam Support ticket**  
If you've completed steps 1 and 2 and are still seeing this error, please [submit a ticket to Steam Support](https://help.steampowered.com).
