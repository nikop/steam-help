Please use all custom content at your own risk[/section]\n\nThere are a wide variety of community made custom maps available for all Valve multiplayer games, as well as many community made game Modifications (Mods) that utilize custom maps.\n\nMany of these maps are automatically downloaded when you connect to a server running them and you do not already have the custom map installed. However, some servers do not allow map downloading which may require you to download and install your custom maps manually.\n\n[h1]Downloading Map Packages from the Internet[/h1]Most map authors will package maps as:\n[list]     [*]executable installers (files with an .EXE extension)[/*]     [*]archives (files with a .ZIP or .RAR extension)[/*] [/list]\n[b]Note[/b]: It is important that you only download packaged maps from reputable game resource sites. If the download is not from a site that you trust, do not install it.\n\nIf you are having difficulty finding sites for custom maps you can post for advice on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/discussions]Steam Discussions[/url] forums for the specific game.\n\n[h1]Installing Custom Map Packages[/h1]Once you have downloaded a custom map or a map pack, you must make sure that the maps are correctly installed before launching the game.\n\nThese files are usually packaged with the correct file directory structure pre-defined so it should only be necessary to install/extract maps and their associated resources to the correct directory if you are extracting the files individually or you are not using a program such as WinZip, WinRar or 7-zip.\n\nBe sure to double check that map resources are installed in the correct directories, as this is the most common reason for custom maps failing to load in-game.\n\n[h5]Custom Map ReadMe files[/h5]Most custom map packages include a ReadMe.txt file. It is always a good idea to read this file before installing a custom map, as many maps might have special installation instructions.\n\n[h5]Installing Maps for Source Engine Games[/h5]To install custom maps for Source engine games (e.g. Day of Defeat: Source, Counter-Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2) you should extract the custom map in to the application directory. For example, the default location is:\n[code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Day of Defeat Source\\dod[/code]\n\nThis should extract content to the correct folders as per the following example:\n\n[list]     [*].BSP Files:\n[code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Day of Defeat Source\\dod\\maps[/code][/*]     [*]Sound Files:\n[code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Day of Defeat Source\\dod\\sound[/code][/*] [/list]\n\n[h5]Installing Maps for Gold Source Games[/h5]To install custom maps for Gold Source engine games (e.g. Day of Defeat, Counter-Strike 1.6, Team Fortress Classic) you should extract the custom map in the application directory. For example:\n[code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike\\cstrike[/code]\n\nThis should extract content to the correct folders as per the following example:\n\n[list]     [*].WAD Files:\n[code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike\\cstrike[/code][/*]     [*].BSP Files:\n[code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike\\cstrike\\maps[/code][/*]     [*]Sound Files:\n[code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike\\cstrike\\sound[/code][/*] [/list]\n\n",
