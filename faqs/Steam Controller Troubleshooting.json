You may need to initiate an RMA to pursue a refund or replacement.\n\nYou may request a replacement for your device through the Steam Support site by following the instructions below.\n\n[olist]  \t[*]If purchased on Steam:[/*]  \t[*]Go to [url=https://help.steampowered.com]https://help.steampowered.com[/url][/*]  \t[*]Select [i]A Purchase[/i][/*]  \t[*]Locate and select the Steam Controller[/*]  \t[*]Select [i]Technical Issue[/i][/*]  \t[*]Select [i]I would like a replacement[/i][/*]  \t[*]Follow the instructions to request your replacement[/*]  [/olist]\n\nMore information about Steam Hardware returns and replacements is available here:\n\n[list]  \t[*][url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/04AE-8A9A-F64E-D165]Steam Hardware RMA Guide[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4E41-6123-79EF-25BA]Steam Hardware Warranty[/url][/*]  [/list][/expand][expand type=title title=\u0022Diagnostics Passed\u0022]\n\nIf the problem does not appear to be hardware related, then it may be a software issue. Our developers frequently read the Steam Hardware Forums, and are constantly releasing updates and bug fixes. Please submit all bugs and feedback to the Steam Hardware forums, found here:\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/353370/discussions/]Visit Steam Discussions[/url][/expand]\n\nIf further assistance is required please contact Steam Support:\n\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithGame/?appid=353370]Contact Support[/url]       \n   \n[h4]Intended Trackpad Dead Zone Area[/h4]To avoid unintentional inputs while switching between the right trackpad and the face buttons (A B X Y), the lower left edge of the right trackpad will sometimes deliberately ignore input. This is intended behavior and does not indicate a defect with your controller.\n\nIf another piece of your hardware has been lost or damaged, please contact Steam Support for replacement options.\n\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithGame/?appid=353370]Contact Support[/url]  \n\n",
