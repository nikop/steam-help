  "content": "When creating an account, I get the message:\n[h5]Looks like your email address is already associated with another Steam account.\n\nYou can use your existing account or recover it if you\u0027ve forgotten your login.[/h5]\n\nThis means the email address you\u0027ve entered when trying to create your Steam account is already in use by another Steam account. \n[section style=important][h3]Important:[/h3]If you already have a Steam account that contains your Steam games, you\u0027d need to log into that account to access your games. Select [url=https://store.steampowered.com/login]Use existing account[/url] if you remember the account\u0027s login information, or [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithLoginInfo?issueid=406]Recover my account[/url] if you\u0027ve forgotten. [/section]\n\n[h2]Why should I recover my existing account instead of creating a new one?[/h2]\nSteam games, including Steam Store purchases and activated game codes, can only be played from the account they were originally purchased or activated with. Creating a new account will not allow you to access the games you\u0027ve purchased or activated previously. If you don\u0027t remember your existing account\u0027s credentials, you can [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithLogin]recover them through Steam Support[/url].\n\n\n[h2]Can I create a new account anyway?[/h2]\nWhile it\u0027s generally advisable to use just one Steam account, there is no limit to the number of Steam accounts that can be used with a single email address. If you\u0027re sure you\u0027d like to create a new account, you can select [b]Continue[/b] to proceed with the account creation process.",
