### What happened to the HLDSUpdateTool? Why can't I download or update servers from it?
All Steam game servers now use SteamCMD to download and update game server files. HLDSUpdateTool has been retired and will no longer function.  
  
### How do I setup and use SteamCMD to install and update my game servers?
For more information on installing and using SteamCMD, please see the [Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) which includes the latest information on SteamCMD.  
  
### Where can I find a list of supported games?
For a list of dedicated servers and games that SteamCMD supports on Steam, please see the [Dedicated Servers List](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dedicated_Servers_List).  
  
You can also post questions and search for help in [Steam Discussions](http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/#tools).
