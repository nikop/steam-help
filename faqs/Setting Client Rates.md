If you notice connection problems during Steam downloads, or want to limit how much bandwidth Steam can use, you can find these settings by doing the following.  
  

* Go to the upper left in the Steam client and select **Steam** > **Settings** from the drop down menu ![{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/79b88e3bd0e6fa48b2ee3aa32ab78ea8bbc1d513.png]({STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/79b88e3bd0e6fa48b2ee3aa32ab78ea8bbc1d513.png)
* Select the Downloads tab from the window that appears

* Here you can find different download settings for Steam including the **Limit bandwidth to:** setting. If you enable it you can set the limit you would want.
