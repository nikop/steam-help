Exclude Steam from Time Machine

[h2]I'm using Time Machine and each time a game gets updated it backs up the entire game again. How can I stop this?[/h2]

When setting up Time Machine on your computer make sure that you exclude the /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/:

[list]
[*]From the macOS Apple menu, select System Preferences, then Time Machine
[*]Click Options, then click the "+" to add items to the exclusion list
[*]Add your [b]/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/[/b] folder to the exclusion list[/list]
Time Machine will no longer backup your SteamApps folder each time a game is updated. This will avoid large amounts of data being backed up with only minor updates.
