If you would like to play the game again in the future, you will need to purchase it from the Steam Store or redeem another gift copy of the title.\n\n[h4]I traded items for my gift. Can I have these items restored?[/h4]If you performed a trade to receive this game, Steam Support will not restore any items that were exchanged for the removed gift.\n\n[h4]I bought this game from a third party. Will I get a refund?[/h4]If you or someone you know purchased this gift subscription through a third party website, we suggest contacting the seller to request a refund.
