If, when opening the browser or pressing the refresh button, servers appear very slowly, then your rate may be set incorrectly. Please see the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/163C-7C89-406E-2F63]Setting Client Rates[/url] article for instructions on setting the proper rates.\n\n[h4]Router Problem[/h4]Some routers may have firmware that experiences packet loss with high traffic, such as when a large number of servers are responding during a server browser refresh.  A symptom of this is starting a server refresh and always getting the same (or a similar) number of servers before the refresh stops completely, rather than simply pausing.  These routers will also typically go offline for a minute or so when this problem occurs.  The only solutions for this are to update your router\u0027s firmware or replace the router. Please see [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/669A-2F68-D1D1-A5EC]Troubleshooting Network Connectivity[/url], step 2: \u0022Test Your Router\u0022 to determine if this is your issue.\n\n[h4]CyberCafe[/h4]If you are in a CyberCafe and there are a lot of players refreshing their browsers, this may cause problems in the CyberCafe network.  Reducing the Steam rate for all the workstations will help this problem.\n\n",
