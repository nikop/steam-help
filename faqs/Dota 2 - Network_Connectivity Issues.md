I am unable to connect to the Dota 2 network, experiencing network lag in-game, or losing my connection to the Dota 2 servers while playing. What can I do?  
  
### Dota 2 server downtime
Periodically, the Dota 2 servers may need to be brought down temporarily for maintenance or updates. You do not need to report downtime during such outages.  
  
### Troubleshooting connectivity
If you are getting disconnected from Dota 2 across multiple games or with any regularity, this points to an issue with your connection to the Dota 2 or Steam network.  
  
We suggest that you [Troubleshoot your Network's connectivity with Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/669A-2F68-D1D1-A5EC), and remove any [Programs that may interfere with Steam from your computer](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1F39-DCB4-FF28-5748).  
  
If other players in your region are experiencing this issue, ensure that you report it to the [Dota 2 Development Forums](http://dev.dota2.com).
