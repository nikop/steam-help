I get this error: 'Error: Server Verification Failed.' when I connect to some servers

This error message indicates that the game server which you are attempting to connect to is unable to contact the Steam Authentication Servers.

Please observe the following process to determine whether the error is a result of a Steam outage, issues with the game server connecting to the Steam Authentication Servers, or an issue with your internet connection.
