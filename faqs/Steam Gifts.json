Also note that you may only gift new purchases\u2014you may not transfer games you already own. That\u2019d be like wrapping up and presenting the toaster you\u2019ve used every morning for the past year.\n\n[url id=gifts-purchase][/url]\n\n[h2]How can I purchase Steam Gifts for a different Steam user?[/h2]To give a gift to a friend or family member, locate the game you would like to gift on the Steam Storefront and then click the [b]\u0022Add to cart\u0022[/b] button.
