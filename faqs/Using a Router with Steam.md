# Using a Router with Steam
Updated 2021-07-10 19.49.55

How do I determine if my router is causing a Steam connection issue?  How do I configure my router to work with Steam?  
  
#### Basic Router Troubleshooting
It may seem obvious, but it's worth rebooting your modem, router, or modem/router combination device before trying anything else.  
  
If your modem and router (or wireless access point) are separate devices, test with a direct connection to your modem:  

* Close the Steam client application.
* Bypass your router by plugging your machine directly into the modem.
* Test that your internet connection is working, then restart Steam and check connectivity.

  
If you are able to connect to Steam after bypassing your router, it indicates a router configuration or compatibility issue.  
  
#### Router Configuration
Certain router services can cause problems with Steam. If any of the following services are enabled on your router or access point, try disabling them:  

* Stateful inspection
* Dynamic packet filtering
* QoS (Quality of Service)
* UPnP (Universal Plug 'n Play)
