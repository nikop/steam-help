# Repairing Disk Permissions on Mac

I'm having trouble running Steam or playing my games, what can I do to fix it?  
  
Often, disk permissions become inconsistent over time. Some of these problems have a negative impact on Steam. If Steam does not start, or games do not launch, please try this first:  

* Click on **Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility**
* Click on the **First Aid** tab
* Let the repair process finish and then restart Steam to see if this corrects the problem
