When certain Steam account changes are made, a notification will be sent to the email address that is associated with your account. These include the following:\n[list][*]Password changes[/*][*]Email changes[/*][*]Steam Guard code requests[/*]  [/list]\nIn these various notification emails you will find a link to lock your account. Once clicked, you will be taken to a page to complete the process. Even if your email address is changed on your Steam account, you will still receive an email with a lock link confirming the action.\n\n[b]When locking an account, please ensure that you write down the provided unlock code.[/b] Once the account has been secured, this code can be used to remove the restrictions.\n\n\n[url id=demand][/url][h2]Can I lock my account on demand without an email notification?[/h2]At this time you can only lock your account from the link that can be found in the associated email notifications above. You cannot lock your account from directly within the Steam client or any other location.\n\n\n[url id=contact][/url][h2]What do I do after I lock my account?[/h2]If possible, please use [url=https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithAccountStolen]Steam\u0027s Account Recovery tools[/url] to revert any unauthorized changes.\n\nIf you are unable to sign in to the account, you must [url=https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithLogin]contact Steam Support[/url].

What does it restrict exactly?[/h2]The lock that is applied to your account restricts all major actions that can impact you and other Steam users.
