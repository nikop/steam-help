#### Opt into the Steam Client Beta:
Our engineers are constantly updating the Steam Controller by releasing new features and bug fixes. Opting into the [Steam Client Beta](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/1/864957817328247556/) will give you access to these features before they are released to Steam’s main branch.  
  
After opting in, click on your ***Operating System*** for tailored instructions on how to get started.
