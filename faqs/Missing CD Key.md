# Missing CD Key
Updated 2021-12-02 23.19.46

# Game purchased through Steam
#### Valve games
Valve games purchased online through Steam do not include or require a CD key.  
  
#### Third party games
CD keys are issued with many third party games.  In many cases, Steam will display your CD key when you first launch your game.  If your game launches and asks for a CD key you do not have, please try the following:  

* Right-click on the game in the **Library** tab and select **Manage** then **CD keys**. This option is not available for all Steam games and a CD key is not required for all games.
* **Verify integrity of game files**.  Follow the directions in the [Verify Integrity of Game Files](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB) article.

If you are still seeing the issue or have a different issue with the key, please see the [Steam-Issued Activation Keys](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/2FF7-8298-9409-BC1D) page for more information.  
  
  
# Game purchased through a retail store
If your game did not come with a CD key where there should be one printed, you will need to contact the retail store you purchased from to discuss a refund or exchange.
