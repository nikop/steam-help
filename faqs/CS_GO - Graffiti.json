A portion of the proceeds from sales of Community Graffiti Boxes is shared among the community artists.\n[*] Individual graffiti patterns can be purchased from the Steam Community Market.\n[/list][/section]    \n[section id=graffititypes]  [h2]How many different types of graffiti are there?[/h2]There are two different types of graffiti patterns; monochrome and multi-colored. Monochrome (one color) patterns are received as rank up drops and multi-colored patterns are received when purchasing a graffiti box. Both types of graffiti can be traded and sold on the Steam Community Market.[/section]    \n[section id=graffitiuses]  [h2]How many times can I use a graffiti pattern?[/h2]When a player unseals graffiti they can apply that pattern 50 times. Players who unseal a graffiti pattern they already have in their Inventory will receive 50 additional charges to their existing supply.[/section]    \n[section id=graffittitime]  [h2]How often can I apply graffiti?[/h2]Players can apply graffiti once per round, or every 45 seconds, whichever is shorter. Getting a kill in a round-based game mode will allow the player to apply more graffiti.[/section]    \n[section id=graffitilength]  [h2]How long does my graffiti last?[/h2]One application of graffiti lasts 7 minutes and degrades over time until it is no longer visible.[/section]    \n[section id=graffitizone]  [h2]Where can I apply graffiti?[/h2]The graffiti preview shows where and how the graffiti pattern will be applied. If there is no preview then the surface does not support graffiti.[/section]    \n[section id=graffitinumber]  [h2]How many different graffiti patterns can I have equipped at once?[/h2]Players can have as many different graffiti patterns equipped as they want and can use the in-game graffiti menu to select and apply a different graffiti pattern at every application.[/section]    \n[section id=graffiticheck]  [h2]How do I see my available graffiti?[/h2]All graffiti patterns can be viewed in players\u0027 inventories and in the in-game graffiti menu.[/section]    \n[section id=graffitimarket]  [h2]Can I sell and trade my graffiti?[/h2]Graffiti can be sold on the Steam Community Market and traded as long as it is sealed. Once a player has unsealed their graffiti it can not be traded or sold on the Steam Community Market.[/section]    \n[section id=graffitidelete]  [h2]Can I delete graffiti from my Inventory?[/h2]Yes, but the graffiti must be unsealed. Once you have unsealed the graffiti, locate the item in your CS:GO inventory, right click on it, then select \u0027Delete Item\u0027.[/section]",
