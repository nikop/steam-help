Dota 2\u0027s art style follows very important general design concepts that apply to the readability and quality execution of all items, including inventive items that thoughtfully differ from the defaults and add to the appeal of our game. These principles are covered in the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0688-7692-4D5A-1935]Character Art Guide[/url] and other [url=http://www.dota2.com/workshop/#creation]Asset Creation Guidelines[/url] that have been updated and expanded for Source 2.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[url id=copyright][/url]\n\n[h2]What should always be avoided when creating items for Dota 2?[/h2][list]  \t[*]Obscenity: We will automatically reject any obscene items.

If the item has not shipped, you can create a new workshop submission with the preferred revenue shares. Notify Valve of this change through the private developer comments on the old and new submissions and put a link to the new submission in the developer comments for the old item. If this item is part of a collection, you should remove the old item from the collection and replace it with the new one. Once the item ships we cannot change revenue shares.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[url=http://www.dota2.com/workshop/]Dota 2 Item Workshop Guidelines Homepage[/url]\n\n",
