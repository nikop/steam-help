Removing headset

You should be able to slide the headset on and off without making any additional adjustments.

Valve’s Index Controllers are designed to give you smarter hands in VR. There are several adjustment mechanisms in place that can help you find your perfect fit. You’ll know you are ready to get started when:
[list]
[*]Your index finger rests comfortably on the trigger. [/*]
[*]The pad of your thumb rests naturally on the Track Button’s surface without obscuring the LED above or the System Button below. [/*]
[*]The hand strap rests behind your knuckles on the back of your hand. [/*]
[*]For added security, tighten the Index Controllers to your wrists using the provided lanyards. [/*]
