[list]  	[*]We occasionally need to request alternate low-violence versions of some workshop items with some or all of the following changes:  	[list]  		[*]Replace or remove human skulls and some types of bones[/*]  		[*]Replace or remove excessive wounds or entrails[/*]  		[*]Darken or remove bright red blood[/*]  	[/list]  	[/*]  	[*]If low violence alternates are requested, they should be submitted to the workshop as new "low-violence" submissions instead of replacing existing submissions.[/*]  	[*]If you prepare a low-violence item, it will preview on the regular hero base model in the workshop tool, it is not possible to preview items on a low-violence hero base model. [/*]  	[*]Some workshop reference files available through the [url=http://www.dota2.com/workshop/requirements]Hero Resource[/url] pages include low-violence models, textures or images. Low-violence files will have an "lv" in the file name.[/*]  [/list]

[list]  	[*]If you have excessive blood on items, it will be helpful to keep the blood on a separate layer in your texture source file so that it will be easy to darken or remove the blood if this is requested.[/*]  [/list]
