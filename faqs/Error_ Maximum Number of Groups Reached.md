#### Why am I getting a max group limit error when trying to join a group?
Once you have joined **1,000** Steam groups, you will be unable to join any more groups. This limit does not include groups that you have created or official game groups.

#### How can I join more groups?
To join more groups, please leave as many groups as needed to be below the limit. Navigate to [your groups page](http://steamcommunity.com/my/groups/) and click "Leave Group" next to the respective group(s).  
  
Remember, [Official Game Groups](http://steamcommunity.com/my/followedgames) that you are following do not count towards the limit - there is no need to leave or unfollow them.

#### Is this limit dependent on my Steam Level?
No, your Steam level only affects your friends limit.
