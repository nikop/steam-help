[/list]\n[url id=12][/url]\n[h2]Why does the video look corrupted with random blocks appearing?[/h2]On some system configurations the combination of video hardware, video drivers and Steam\u0027s hardware acceleration can cause large pixels or macro blocks to appear on screen during playback. For some users, turning off Hardware Video Decoding can resolve this issue:\n[olist]  \t[*]From the Steam Menu, select Settings  \t[*]From the settings list, click Interface  \t[*]Uncheck \u0022Enable hardware video decoding, if supported\u0022  \t[*]Click OK and Restart Steam  \t[*]Play the Streaming Video to test this change  [/olist]\n[url id=15][/url]\n[h2]What are the \u0022additional components\u0022 required for playback?[/h2]When the Steam Client starts up, a set of components required to playback DRM encrypted content is downloaded. If you receive a message indicating the additional components failed to download, you can attempt to download and install the components manually. This may be necessary if your ISP restricts access to certain domains or URLs.\n\nIf you have issues completing the steps below, please create a support ticket at [url=https://help.steampowered.com]https://help.steampowered.com[/url] and we\u0027ll be happy to assist you step by step.

For consumers without a SteamVR compatible headset, a version of the player is available for watching videos on their desktop monitors.\n[url id=360_install][/url]\n[h2]Installing the Steam 360 Video Player[/h2][olist]    [*]Check the [url=#360_sysreqs]system requirements[/url] below. At the start of this beta, Windows 10 64-bit is a requirement.    [*]The Steam 360 Video tool requires a Steam Client released on or after April 25th 2017. If you aren\u2019t running the latest Steam Client, make sure to update from the Steam menu, Check for Steam Client Updates...    [*]For HMD support, make sure SteamVR is installed. You\u2019ll find that in your Steam Client in the Library in your Tool category, or you can use the search box to search \u0022SteamVR\u0022 to find it quickly. [*]For non-HMD playback, SteamVR is not required but there is currently no support for stereo playback.    [*]In your Steam Library, you\u2019ll find the Steam 360 Video tool. You can use the search box to search \u0022Steam 360\u0022 to find it quickly. Click on it, then click Install. A small download will occur and the player will be installed. Alternatively, the first time you attempt to watch a 360 video, you will be prompted to install the 360 video player.  [/olist]\n[url id=360_content][/url]\n[h2]What\u0027s available to watch now?[/h2]To get started, take a look at this page to see what\u0027s on offer today: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?tags=776177\u0026category1=992]Steam 360 Videos[/url]\n\nOnce a 360 video has been added to your Steam Library, you\u2019ll find it by searching the name of the video in your Library. Look for videos that have a [360] suffix added to their name. 360 videos will also appear in a VR category of the Library.\n[url id=360_sysreqs][/url]\n[h2]What are the system requirements to play a Steam 360 Video?[/h2]The minimum specifications for 360 video playback today are essentially the same as the minimum specs for your Virtual Reality HMD. Specifics are outlined on the store page for a video but in general are:\n\n[list]    [*]OS: Windows 10, 64-Bit Only    [*]Processor: Intel\u00AE i5-4590, AMD FX 8350 equivalent or better    [*]Memory: 4 GB RAM    [*]Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce\u00AE GTX 970, AMD Radeon\u2122 R9 290 equivalent or better    [*]Network: Broadband Internet connection    [*]Storage: 50 MB available space  [/list]\n\nPlease be aware that playing back a 4K x 4K stereo video requires at least a GTX 1070 or equivalent AMD graphics card. If your computer cannot maintain playback at full resolution, a lower resolution will be automatically selected. A future update to the Steam 360 Video platform will introduce stereo FOVAS (see [url=#360_formats]360 Formats[/url] below) which will reduce the required bandwidth and video card requirements.\n[url id=360_controls][/url]\n[h2]How do I control the Steam 360 Video player?[/h2][b]HTC Vive Controllers[/b]  [list]    [*]If you have an HTC Vive, the controller should appear while you are watching the video in the HMD.    [*]Click up on the touch pad to pause or play the video.    [*]Click left or right on the touch pad to skip forward and back.    [*]Click down on the touch pad to stop the video.     [*]The current play time and play state will be shown just above the first active controller in the HMD.  [*]Pull the trigger and you\u0027ll be shown the current quality level. Then click up or down to change to a different quality level. Click right (the A in a circle) and the video will go back to Automatic quality mode.   [/list]\n\n[b]Oculus Touch Controllers[/b]  [list]    [*]If you have an Oculus Touch, the controller should appear while you are watching the video in the HMD.    [*]Push up on either thumbstick to pause or play the video.    [*]Push left or right on either thumbstick to skip forward and back.    [*]Push down on either thumbstick to stop the video.     [*]The current play time and play state will be shown just above the first active controller in the HMD.    [*]Pull either trigger and you\u0027ll be shown the current quality level. Then push up or down to change to a different quality level. Push right and the video will go back to Automatic quality mode.     [/list]\n\n[b]Gamepad / XInput Devices[/b]\t  [list]    [*]If you have a gamepad, the video UI will show up in a fixed position (either the forward direction in the HMD or at the bottom of the desktop window)     [*]Push up on either thumbstick to pause or play the video.    [*]Push left or right on either thumbstick to skip forward and back.    [*]Push down on either thumbstick to stop the video.     [*]The current play time and play state will be shown just above the first active controller in the HMD.    [*]Pull either trigger and you\u0027ll be shown the current quality level. Then push up or down to change to a different quality level. Push right and the video will go back to Automatic quality mode.     [*]Note: Gamepad input does not work if you are using an HTC Vive controller setup.  [/list]\n\n[b]Keyboard[/b]  [list]    [*]If you are using a keyboard, the video UI will show up in a fixed position (either the forward direction in the HMD or at the bottom of the desktop window)     [*]Press the space bar on the keyboard to pause or play the video.    [*]Press the left or right arrow keys to skip forward and back.    [*]Press escape to quit the video.    [*]Press up or down on the arrow keys to switch between the different quality modes.    [*]Press A to switch back into automatic quality mode.    [/list]\n\n[b]Mouse Mode[/b]  [list]    [*]A mouse can be used when an HMD is not present and SteamVR is not installed. The 360 video will appear in a window on the desktop monitor.     [*]Left-click and drag in the window to move the around in the 360 video.    [*]Right-click to show and hide the analytics and help information.    [*]Keyboard input must be used for seeking or pausing the video at this time.\n[/list]\n[url id=360_formats][/url]\n[h2]What do the 360 Formats on the store page mean?[/h2]There are 4 variations of 360 videos currently supported on Steam. Depending upon how the content creator has configured the video, you will see a combination of 1 or 2 and, 3 or 4.\n\n[olist]    [*][b]Mono[/b] \u2013 This means the video was captured from a single position in space (whether virtual or real space) and the result is both eyes in the VR HMD are shown the same image. While you can look around, there will be no sense of depth in the video during playback.    [*][b]Stereo[/b] \u2013 This means the video was captured from two positions in space (whether virtual or real space) and the result is each eye in the VR HMD sees a slightly different image. When combined, this provides depth and distance in a 360 video.    [*][b]Equirectangular[/b] \u2013 When you look at a map of the Earth on a wall, you\u2019re often seeing an equirectangular projection. It\u2019s flattened so you can see all of the Earth at once, but distorts the content toward the top and bottom. 360 videos use this technique to capture and playback a 360 view in a rectangular video frame. When the video is played back, the flattened video frame is wrapped around a sphere to restore the original 360 view.    [*][b]FOVAS (Field of View Adaptive Streaming)[/b] \u2013 When using FOVAS, the amount of network bandwidth needed is reduced by presenting only the content directly in front of the user\u2019s eyes with the highest level of detail. The rest of the 360 view is lower quality. As the user moves their head around, a different area of detail is then loaded to maintain the lower bandwidth requirements.[/olist]\n\n",
