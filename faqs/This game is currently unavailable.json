These include installers for DirectX, PhysX, Games for Windows Live, C\u002B\u002B components, or Windows updates required by the game.\n\nSteam is designed to run these installers when the game is first launched. If an installer is canceled by a user or prevented from running by another application on your system, the game may not launch correctly.  If this occurs, these installers will need to be launched manually.\n\nThese installers are found in the game\u0027s installation folder, or a subfolder, found in the following location by default: [b]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\\u003CGame Title\u003E\\[/b].\n\n[section style=note]Note: Your installation path may differ from the above location.[/section]\n\n",
