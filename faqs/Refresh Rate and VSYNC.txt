What are [b]refresh rate[/b] and [b]VSYNC[/b] and how do they affect gameplay?


[h1]Refresh Rates[/h1]
This setting determines how many times your display is illuminated every second. This is distinct from the measure of frames per second (FPS). The refresh rate includes the repeated illumination of identical frames, while the FPS is a measure of how often a display can change from one image to another.

Please follow these steps if you would like to change the refresh rate for your display:

[h1]VSYNC[/h1]
This setting determines whether or not Windows will allow your games and other applications to display different images at frame rates (FPS) which exceeds your refresh rate. If you have disabled VSYNC you may experience visual "tearing" and video artifacts while playing, as you will not see all of the frames which are being rendered.
