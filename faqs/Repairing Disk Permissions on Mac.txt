Repairing Disk Permissions on Mac
Updated 2021-08-10 22.10.10

I'm having trouble running Steam or playing my games, what can I do to fix it?

Often, disk permissions become inconsistent over time. Some of these problems have a negative impact on Steam. If Steam does not start, or games do not launch, please try this first:
[list]      [*]Click on [b]Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility[/b][/*]      [*]Click on the [b]First Aid[/b] tab[/*]      [*]Let the repair process finish and then restart Steam to see if this corrects the problem[/*]  [/list]
