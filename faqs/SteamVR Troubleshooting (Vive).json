Troubleshooting for the first generation development kit can be found [url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamVR/TroubleshootingFirstGen]here[/url].\n\nIf you have a Vive Pre Developer kit, the troubleshooting instructions below will also apply to you. The only difference is the Vive Pre uses white LEDs instead of green LEDs to signify that a device is ready to be used.\n\nFor a guided troubleshooting experience, please visit the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGame/?appid=250820]SteamVR help site[/url].[/section]        \n\n[section id=gen-pc]\n[h2]General PC Troubleshooting[/h2]\nPlease ensure that you have optimized your PC Settings for SteamVR by completing the following steps:\n\n[list]  \t[*]Set your PC\u0027s power plan to \u0022High performance\u0022 (Press the Windows key \u003E Type: power \u003E Select \u0022Power Options\u0022 \u003E Select \u0022High performance\u0022)[/*]  \t[*]Set NVIDIA power management to \u0022prefer maximum performance\u0022 as outlined [url=http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3130/~/setting-power-management-mode-from-adaptive-to-maximum-performance]here[/url].[/*]  \t[*]Get the latest drivers from [url=http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx]NVIDIA[/url] or [url=http://support.amd.com/en-us/download]AMD[/url].[/*]  \t[*]Set your default audio playback device to HTC-VIVE-0.[/*]  \t[*]Make sure you are running Steam as an administrator.[/*]  [/list]          \n\n[expand type=title title=\u0022Static Electricity\u0022]\nIn some environments, the audio extension cable of the Vive headset can build up static electricity and deliver a small static shock when touched or when used with certain earbuds. This does not necessarily indicate an issue with your Vive - it happens for the same reason that shuffling your feet across carpet and touching a door knob causes a static shock.\n\nSome things to try if this happens regularly:\n\n[list]  \t[*]Use a humidifier \u2013 dry environments are conducive for static buildup[/*]  \t[*]Anti-static sprays can help reduce environmental static[/*]  \t[*]Anti-static lotion can help customers with dry skin who experience this issue[/*]  \t[*]Clothing made of natural fibers are less likely to hold a static charge than clothing made of synthetic materials.[/*]  [/list][/expand]  [/section]              \n\n[section id=headset]\n[h2]Headset[/h2]\nIf you are experiencing issues with the Headset, please see the topics below for troubleshooting suggestions:\n\n[expand type=title title=\u0022Error 108 (Headset not found)\u0022]\n\nThis error may be a USB driver issue. Please try the following troubleshooting steps:\n\nRestart your headset:\n\n[olist]  \t[*]Right click on the headset icon in SteamVR.[/*]  \t[*]Select Restart Headset, and wait while the process completes.[/*]  [/olist]\n\nPower cycle your Link Box:\n\n[olist]  \t[*]Quit SteamVR[/*]  \t[*]Unplug the Power and USB cords from the PC side of the Link Box (not the orange side).[/*]  \t[*]Wait a few seconds, then plug the Power and USB cords back into the Link Box. You may see more drivers install. Wait for this process to finish.[/*]  \t[*]Launch SteamVR.[/*]  \t[*]Repeat steps if needed[/*]  [/olist]\n\nRestart your computer (Quit SteamVR before shutting down your PC)\n\nPlug your Link Box into a different USB port on your PC:\n\n[olist]  \t[*]Try plugging your Link Box into a USB 2.0 port, as some USB 3.0 and 3.1 chipsets can cause issues.[/*]  \t[*]You can also try a USB port that\u0027s already in-use and working - move the other device to another port and plug in your Link Box.[/*]  \t[*]If this problem persists, try resetting your USB devices.[/*]  [/olist]\n[/expand][expand type=title title=\u0022Error 109 / Error 400\u0022]\n\nYou may see one of these errors if you are not connected to your machine\u0027s dedicated graphics card.\n\nPlease make sure that both the Vive\u0027s Link Box and your primary display are connected to the same GPU. If you are using a laptop, make sure that you are connected to the machine\u2019s discrete GPU. You may need to set your machine to \u0022prefer maximum performance.\u0022\n\nAdditionally, if you have multiple graphics cards in a desktop PC, make sure that the Vive and your primary display are connected to the same card. Some users have reported that connecting their primary monitor over DVI causes issues next to the Vive. Try using a DisplayPort or HDMI connection.\n\n[/expand][expand type=title title=\u0022Resetting USB Devices\u0022]\n\nAs a last resort for headset detection issues, you can reset your SteamVR USB devices.\n\n[olist]  \t[*]Unplug all Link Box cables from your PC.[/*]  \t[*]From the SteamVR window on your desktop, open the menu in the upper left and go to Developer \u003E Developer Settings.[/*]  \t\t[*]Under Reset, click on Remove all SteamVR USB Devices. Make sure the Link Box\u0027s USB cable is not plugged in and click Yes.[/*]  \t[*]Once this is complete, quit SteamVR, plug your Link Box in (USB, HDMI, Power), and re-launch SteamVR.[/*]  [/olist][/expand][expand type=title title=\u0022New USB PCI-Express Card\u0022]\n\nIf you\u0027ve tried all of the above and continue to have issues, your USB chipset may be at fault.\n\nOur testing has shown that the Inateck 2-Port USB3.0 PCI-Express Card (Serial: KTU3FR-2O2I) works reliably with the HTC Vive and can overcome these kinds of USB issues.\n\n[/expand][expand type=title title=\u0022Error 208 (HMD detected over USB, but monitor not found)\u0022]\n\nError 208 is a generic HMD error message. This error can have a number of solutions, so please work from the list below to make sure you\u0027ve attempted all available solutions:\n\n[list]  \t[*]Make sure that your Vive\u2019s Link Box and the monitor or TV you use as a primary display are plugged into the same graphics card. If you are connected to your onboard display adapter, you will see an Intel HD Graphics device listed in your SteamVR system report. Onboard cards, such as those connected to a PC\u2019s motherboard, will not be powerful enough to use the Vive. Reconnect your Vive to your PC\u2019s dedicated graphics card.[/*]  \t[*]Check to make sure you are in Direct Display Mode by going to the menu in the upper left of the SteamVR window and then Developer \u003E Developer Settings \u003E Direct Display Mode. Click the button that says \u201CEnable Direct Display Mode.\u201D SteamVR will restart with this setting.[/*]  \t[*]If Direct Display Mode is not enabled, SteamVR will still work but will run in Extended Mode. For this to work correctly, make sure your displays are extended in Windows \u003E Display Settings.[/*]  \t[*]Make sure all cables are connected firmly. The power cord on the HMD itself can become loose from usage. To check this, remove the cable panel on top of the HMD by pushing it forward.[/*]  \t[*]Make sure your Link Box is installed in the correct direction. The orange tipped cables from the Headset should be connected to the orange ports on the Link Box.[/*]  \t[*]Check to make sure you have the latest video drivers.[/*]  [/list][/expand][expand type=title title=\u0022Headset not detected\u0022][list]  \t[*]Make sure the headset is properly plugged in.[/*]  \t[*]The end of your Headset\u0027s tether has three orange tipped cords (USB, HDMI, and Power). Plug all three of these into the side of the Link Box with orange ports.[/*]  \t[*]If you have a first generation Vive Development Kit, do not mix and match the parts. They are not compatible.[/*]  \t[*]Plug the power cord into the Link Box, and plug it into a power outlet.[/*]  \t[*]Use the included USB cable to connect the Link Box to an available USB port on your PC. (Vive supports USB 2.0 or greater, but we have encountered issues with certain USB 3.0 ports.

If it never changes from blue, check to make sure the base is mounted securely. Vibrations can cause it to be stuck in this state.[/*]  \t[*]If the LED is dim green, it\u0027s in standby mode. If unintentionally in this state, try unplugging and replugging the base station to fix this.[/*]  \t[*]If the LED is solid or blinking purple, the base stations are having trouble seeing each other. Make sure nothing is in the way.[/*]  \t[*]If the LED is off, it doesn\u0027t have power \u2013 make sure that the power cord is plugged in and your outlet isn\u0027t connected to a light switch.[/*]  \t[*]White: Ready state [Vive Pre development kit only][/*]  [/list]\n\n[/expand][expand type=title title=\u0022Optical Sync\u0022]\n\nIf your base stations aren\u0027t working correctly, make sure they are properly set up for optical sync.\n\n[list]  \t[*]Check SteamVR to see if your base stations need a firmware update.[/*]  \t[*]Make sure your base stations have an unobstructed view of each other.[/*]  \t[*]Base stations shouldn\u0027t be further than 5m or 16ft apart.[/*]  \t[*]Push the mode buttons on the back of the base stations so that one base station is \u0022[b]b[/b]\u0022 and one base station shows \u0022[b]c[/b]\u0022.[/*]  \t[*]The base station lights should now turn solid green.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[/expand][expand type=title title=\u0022Cabled Sync\u0022]\n\nIf your room makes it impossible for the bases to see each other (and the LED is purple), there is another way to sync.\n\n[olist]  \t[*]In the box you\u0027ll find a very long cable \u2013 this is the sync cable.

Open your Frame Timing graph (from the SteamVR menu, choose Developer \u003E Advanced Frame Timing) and look for frame timing spikes. If you see spikes, the issue is most likely with CPU performance, and not with tracking.\n\nIf a device\u0027s icon in SteamVR Status is pulsing green, it means it is not tracking. The in-headset displays go grey when your headset loses tracking. Check the following if you are having tracking issues:\n\n[list]  \t[*]Make sure your base stations are set up correctly. They should be above head height (at least 6.5 feet), angled down 30-45 degrees, and no further than 5 meters, or 16 feet, apart.[/*]  \t[*]Check to make sure your devices are in view of at least one base station, and your bases are powered and synced. Their LEDs should be green if everything is good. See the Base Stations section above for more information about syncing.[/*]  \t[*]Loose cable connections can also cause tracking issues. Make sure all connections at the headset, Link Box, and PC are secure.[/*]  \t[*]While most issues caused by reflective surfaces have been solved, in some situations they can still cause tracking issues. If you are losing tracking or motion controllers occasionally float away in VR, try covering reflective surfaces in your VR area.[/*]  \t[*]If your headset has a front-facing camera, enabling it can sometimes cause tracking issues. If you lose tracking every time you bring up your dashboard, your camera may be at fault. Try disabling the camera or adjusting camera settings to see whether tracking improves.[/*]  [/list]  [/section]        \n\n[section id=steamvr-issues]\n[h2]SteamVR Issues (Error 301)[/h2]\nIf you are experiencing problems with missing or corrupt files in SteamVR or you are encountering an Error 301, make sure the SteamVR tool is correctly installed by verifying the integrity of tool files.\n\n[olist]  \t[*]Quit SteamVR and go to the Steam Client.[/*]  \t[*]Locate SteamVR in your Library (you may have to enable Tools in the drop-down).[/*]  \t[*]Right click on SteamVR and select Properties.
