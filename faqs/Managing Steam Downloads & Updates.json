From here you can track the progress of your downloads, schedule updates, re-order your update queue and see which updates have been completed.\n\n[h5]How to access the Steam Download Manager:[/h5][list]  [*]The [i]Downloads[/i] link at the bottom of the Steam client  [*]Or, from the [i]View[/i] dropdown at the top of the Steam client, select [i]Downloads[/i]  [*]Or, from the [i]Library[/i] tab at the top of the Steam client, select [i]Downloads[/i]  [/list]  [h5]How to access Steam downloads settings:[/h5][list]  [*]From the Steam client, select [i]Steam \u003E Settings \u003E Downloads[/i]  [/list]  \n[section id=bandwidth]  [h4]Setting Bandwidth Limits[/h4]If you\u0027d like to limit the amount of bandwidth that Steam can use when updating and downloading your games, a bandwidth limit can be setup from your Steam settings. The bandwidth limit will be displayed in the upper right corner of the Download Manager, as well as the update dialog for any game you are attempting to launch.\n\nFrom your downloads settings ([i]Steam \u003E Settings \u003E Downloads[/i]) select a corresponding limit from the dropdown. Note that these limits are based on whether you have Steam set to display downloads in bytes per second or bits per second.[/section]    [section id=customize]  [h4]Customizing settings per game[/h4]Games are automatically put into your download queue when a game releases an update. Here\u0027s how you can customize updates per game:\n[list]  [*]Open your Steam Library[/*]  [*]From a game\u0027s library page, select [b]Manage \u003E Properties[/b].[/*]  [*]Select the [b]Updates[/b] tab and make your choice from [b]Automatic updates[/b]  [/list]\nAvailable settings:  [list][*]\u0022Always keep this game updated\u0022  [*]\u0022Only update this game when I launch it\u0022 - will temporarily disable game updates  [*]\u0022High Priority - Always auto-update this game before others\u0022  [/list]\nThere\u0027s also a per-game setting to allow/prevent the downloading of other updates while you\u0027re playing.[/section]    [section id=disable]  [h4]Disabling automatic updates[/h4]If you\u0027d like to stop Steam from automatically updating a game, select \u0022Only update this game when I launch it\u0022 from the game\u0027s Library page \u003E Properties \u003E Updates.[/section]    [section id=scheduling]  [h4]Scheduling automatic updates[/h4]Your queued downloads can be manually re-ordered from your Download Manager.\n\nYou can also limit the times during the day when Steam updates your games. From your downloads settings ([i]Steam \u003E Settings \u003E Downloads[/i]) check the [i]Only auto-update games[/i] box and specify the time when Steam should perform auto-updates. For example, selecting \u002712AM\u0027 And \u00278AM\u0027 would mean that Steam will only download auto-updated games between midnight and 8 AM your local time.\n\nYou can override this, and tell Steam to download the update immediately from the Download Manager. Launching the game will also force the game to update immediately[/section]    [section id=install]  [h4]Moving game installations[/h4]If you are running out of space, or simply want to move some games to an alternate location, Steam Library folders can be used to manage game installations across multiple hard drives.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve setup alternate Library folders, you can move existing games there without requiring new downloads. You can also pick the install location from all of your existing Library folders when downloading a new game.\n[list]  [*]Right-click a game in your Library and select [i]Properties...[/i]  [*]Select the [i]Local Files[/i] tab  [*]Click [i]Move Install Folder...[/i] and select the new location for the game installation  [/list]  [/section]\n[section id=issues]  [h4]Issues with Downloads \u0026 Updates[/h4]If you are experiencing an issue with a download or update, please visit the following help articles:\n[list]  [*][url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/21F5-8D5D-0141-7A5E]Update \u0026 Installation Issues[/url]  [*][url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/669A-2F68-D1D1-A5EC]Troubleshooting Network Connectivity[/url]  [*][url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5AC5-8056-E88F-F3FF]Slow Downloads[/url]  [/list]  [/section]",
