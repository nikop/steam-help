How do I get in-game graffiti?
[/h2]
There are three ways players can get in-game graffiti:
[list]
[*] Players have a chance to receive graffiti as a free weekly drop for ranking up.
[*] Graffiti Boxes featuring art created by Steam Community Artists can be purchased. A portion of the proceeds from sales of Community Graffiti Boxes is shared among the community artists.
[*] Individual graffiti patterns can be purchased from the Steam Community Market.
[/list]

[section id=graffititypes]
[h2]
How many different types of graffiti are there?
[/h2]
There are two different types of graffiti patterns; monochrome and multi-colored. Monochrome (one color) patterns are received as rank up drops and multi-colored patterns are received when purchasing a graffiti box. Both types of graffiti can be traded and sold on the Steam Community Market.
[/section]
[section id=graffitiuses]
[h2]
How many times can I use a graffiti pattern?
[/h2]
When a player unseals graffiti they can apply that pattern 50 times. Players who unseal a graffiti pattern they already have in their Inventory will receive 50 additional charges to their existing supply.
[/section]
[section id=graffittitime]
[h2]
How often can I apply graffiti?
[/h2]
Players can apply graffiti once per round, or every 45 seconds, whichever is shorter. Getting a kill in a round-based game mode will allow the player to apply more graffiti.
[/section]
[section id=graffitilength]
[h2]
How long does my graffiti last?
[/h2]
One application of graffiti lasts 7 minutes and degrades over time until it is no longer visible.
[/section]
[section id=graffitizone]
[h2]
Where can I apply graffiti?
[/h2]
The graffiti preview shows where and how the graffiti pattern will be applied. If there is no preview then the surface does not support graffiti.
[/section]
[section id=graffitinumber]
[h2]
How many different graffiti patterns can I have equipped at once?
[/h2]
Players can have as many different graffiti patterns equipped as they want and can use the in-game graffiti menu to select and apply a different graffiti pattern at every application.
[/section]
[section id=graffiticheck]
[h2]
How do I see my available graffiti?
[/h2]
All graffiti patterns can be viewed in players' inventories and in the in-game graffiti menu.
[/section]
[section id=graffitimarket]
[h2]
Can I sell and trade my graffiti?
[/h2]
Graffiti can be sold on the Steam Community Market and traded as long as it is sealed. Once a player has unsealed their graffiti it can not be traded or sold on the Steam Community Market.
[/section]
[section id=graffitidelete]
[h2]
Can I delete graffiti from my Inventory?
[/h2]
Yes, but the graffiti must be unsealed. Once you have unsealed the graffiti, locate the item in your CS:GO inventory, right click on it, then select 'Delete Item'.
