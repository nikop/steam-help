# Legacy CS:GO Version
Updated 2023-10-10 00:49:37  
Version 1  

Counter-Strike 2 represents the largest technical leap in CS history, and our goal is to continue to develop Counter-Strike for years to come.  
  
As technology advances, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue support for older hardware, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems. Similarly, we will no longer support macOS. Combined, these represented less than one percent of active CS:GO players.  
  
Moving forward, Counter-Strike 2 will exclusively support 64-bit Windows and Linux.  
  
If you are unable to launch Counter-Strike 2 with your current hardware, you can access a legacy version of CS:GO. Support for this version of CS:GO will end on January 1, 2024.

  ### I can't run CS2 because I run DirectX 9 or a 32-bit version of Windows. Am I eligible for a Prime Status Upgrade refund?
DirectX 9 and/or 32-bit Windows users are eligible for a Prime Status Upgrade refund if their purchase was made on Steam between the announcement of the Counter-Strike 2 Limited Test (March 22, 2023) and the launch of Counter-Strike 2 (September 27, 2023).  
  
CD keys, gifts, and accounts with bans are not eligible for a refund.  
  ### I can't run CS2 because I play on a Mac. Am I eligible for a Prime Status Upgrade refund?
macOS users are eligible for a refund if most of their CS:GO playtime was on macOS and they played CS:GO on a Mac between the announcement of the Counter-Strike 2 Limited Test (March 22, 2023) and the launch of Counter-Strike 2 (September 27, 2023), regardless of when they purchased their Prime Status Upgrade.  
  
CD keys, gifts, and accounts with bans are not eligible for a refund.  
  ### How long do I have to claim my refund?
We will be offering refunds until December 1, 2023.  
  ### What is the legacy version of CS:GO?
The legacy version of CS:GO is a frozen build of CS:GO. It has all of the features of CS:GO except for official matchmaking.  
  ### What will happen after the end of support for the legacy version of CS:GO?
After January 1, 2024 the game will still be available, but certain functionality that relies on compatibility with the Game Coordinator (e.g., access to inventory) may degrade and/or fail.
