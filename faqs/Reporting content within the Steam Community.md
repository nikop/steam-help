Steam allows users to interact with each other and share content throughout the community. When posting any content on Steam, we require that users follow our [Rules and Guidelines](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6862-8119-C23E-EA7B) as well as our [Online Conduct Agreement](http://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct).  
  
Users are encouraged to report any content that is in violation of these rules, so that it can be reviewed.
