On the purchase confirmation screen, if you do not switch your intended payment method away from the Wallet, your Wallet funds will be spent. Check your purchase confirmation emails for all of your recent purchases for more information.\n\n[url id=xtrac][/url][h4]Do I get an extra copy to gift if I own a game twice?[/h4]\nUnless otherwise stated, you will not receive extra giftable copies for duplicate purchases on a single Steam account.\n\n[url id=giftpur][/url][h4]The \u0022Purchase as a gift\u0022 option is not available on checkout. Why?[/h4]\nFor various reasons, such as common issues, incompatibility with non-Steam versions, or regional restrictions that are required by the game\u0027s developer or publisher, some games and addons cannot be gifted.\n\nAll multi-pack offers, such as 2, 3, and 4-packs, contain between one and three giftable subscriptions and one subscription towards your own account. If you already have the subscription on your account, you will not be able to purchase the multi-pack, even if your intention is to send all copies as gifts.\n\n[url id=missedsale][/url][h4]I recently purchased a game that is now on sale. Can I refund the difference?[/h4]\nWe are unable to refund the difference in price; however, you [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/784C-923B-A4A1-C825]may request a refund[/url] for the initial purchase and repurchase the game at the current sale price.\n\n[url id=ownershipcheck][/url][h4]I cannot find the content that the Steam Store says that I own. Why?[/h4]\nDue to current technical limitations, The Steam Store may show that you own a special edition of a game when you actually only own the base version. You can check your purchase/activation history to determine which version of this game you own using the following method:\n[olist]  \t\n[*]Log in to your Steam account through the Steam application.  \t\n[*]In the upper right hand corner, click your profile name and select \u0022Account Details\u0022 from the drop down list.  \t\n[*]Click on \u0022View purchase history\u0022 to list your Steam Store transactions, Market purchases, and in-game items or currency purchases. The details include the date of purchase, name of the game or item(s) purchased, and the transaction amount.  \n[/olist]\n[url id=coupons][/url][h4]I have a coupon that I wish to use. Does it stack with a Steam Sale?[/h4]\nUnless clearly stated otherwise, promotions such as coupons or loyalty discounts do not stack with Steam Sale pricing.\n\n[url id=wishlist][/url][h4]How can I avoid missing sales for the games that I want?[/h4]\nSteam\u0027s Wishlist feature can be used to receive a notification when a game that you want goes on sale. You can find more information on how to use the Steam Wishlist feature here:\n[list]\n[*][url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0CAD-3B4D-B874-A065]The Steam Wishlist Feature[/url]\n[*][url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/emailoptout]Email Preferences[/url]\n[/list]\n[url id=other][/url][h4]What other resources are there for billing issues?[/h4]\nRefer to our [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=92]General Billing[/url] or [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=60]Refunds and Returns[/url] support articles for more information.
