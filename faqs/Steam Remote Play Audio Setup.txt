Steam supports streaming stereo (2 channel) audio from all streaming host operating systems to all streaming clients (including the Steam Link). Steam Clients running on Windows can also stream quadraphonic (4 channel) and 5.1 surround sound (6 channel) audio to all streaming clients.

What 5.1 audio can Steam record?
[/h3]
Steam currently only records 5.1 audio from processes launched through Steam on Windows. Other host system audio will be mixed with audio recorded from the game process as stereo audio.

Requirements for 5.1 audio on TV
[/h3]
The Steam Client and Steam Link output 6 channel PCM audio when configured for 5.1 surround sound audio. When connected to a TV, the TV or audio receiver need to support 6 channel PCM. Please refer to your device's user manual to check if your device supports this format. It is usually required to use an HDMI cable to connect to your Steam Link, instead of an optical cable, to enable PCM support.
