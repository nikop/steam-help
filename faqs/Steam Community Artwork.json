This work and any copyright or stolen material should be reported and will be removed.\n\n[h2]Why has my artwork been marked as incompatible?[/h2]If your artwork has been marked as incompatible that means a member of Steam Support found it to be unrelated to the hub or inappropriate in some way. It will no longer be seen on the hub, but will remain viewable to you and your friends from your profile.\n\n[h2]Why has my artwork been banned?[/h2]If your artwork has been banned that means a member of Steam Support found it to violate the Steam Terms of Service. It will no longer be seen on the hub, and will be viewable only to you from your profile. Commonly banned items include: offensive content (e.g. racism), pornography (e.g. pornographic sprays/decals), stolen artwork, etc.\n\n[h2]How do I report a piece of artwork?[/h2]From the hub, click on the artwork to open the pop up window and select \u0022Report\u0022 from the options drop down (the gear icon on the right.)\n\nFrom the artwork\u2019s detail page, click \u0022Flag\u0022 icon in the bar directly beneath the image.\n\n",
