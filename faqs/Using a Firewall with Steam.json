Some Steam games may also prompt for firewall authorization after a game update.[/section]    [h4]Troubleshooting Steps[/h4][olist]  \t[*]Close the Steam client application.[/*]  \t[*]Open the configuration view for your firewall program, and remove any instances of the following executables from the permissions:\n[list]  \t\t[*]steaminstall.exe[/*]  \t\t[exclude_realm=china][*]steam.exe[/*][/exclude_realm]  \t\t[exclude_realm=global][*]steamchina.exe[/*][/exclude_realm]  \t\t[*]hl.exe[/*]  \t\t[*]hl2.exe[/*]  \t\t[*]steamTmp.exe[/*]  \t[/list]  \t[/*]  \t[*]Start Steam. Your firewall should prompt you to set new permissions for steam.exe. If it does not, the security settings may be too strict - you will need to change these settings so you will be prompted to set permissions.\n\nGive the Steam executables permission for all TCP and UDP ports when prompted.[/*]  \t[*]Restart your computer and start Steam.[/*]  [/olist]    [h4] [/h4]If you are still having connectivity problems, you may try the following test:\n[list]  \t[*]Exit the Steam client.[/*]  \t[*]Temporarily disable your firewall.[/*]  \t[*]Restart Steam and test connectivity.[/*]  \t[*]Re-enable your firewall.[/*]  [/list]\nIf Steam operates normally only when your firewall is disabled, please recheck your firewall configuration. You may wish to contact the provider of your firewall for configuration help. [b]We do not recommend leaving your firewall disabled.[/b]\n\nIf you still experience problems with the firewall disabled, please see the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/669A-2F68-D1D1-A5EC]Troubleshooting Network Connectivity[/url] topic for further troubleshooting recommendations.\n\n",
