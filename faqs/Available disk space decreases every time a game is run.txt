Disabling System Restore for any drive which you do not back up regularly is [b]not[/b] recommended.
[/section]
There are several causes for this condition which this article will not cover:
[list]
[*]Game patches and updates are being downloaded automatically through Steam [/*]
[*]Files for saved games are being created (for single-player games) [/*]
[*]Custom content downloads are occurring (for multiplayer games) [/*]
[/list]
If you notice that [b]50 - 100 MB[/b] of available hard disk space is being used every time you start a game, you may need to disable System Restore for the drive which is storing your game files.
