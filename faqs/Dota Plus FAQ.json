For example, Random Draft mode counts, but Ability Draft, bot matches, and custom games do not.\n\nTurbo games grant half the normal hero xp for wins/losses.  [/section]    [section id=cancelsub]  [h3]What happens if I cancel my subscription?[/h3]Dota Plus will still be active until the end of your scheduled renewal date. You will not be charged upon the renewal date and Dota Plus will no longer be active on your account.[/section]    [section id=inactive]  [h3]What happens when Dota Plus is no longer active on my account?[/h3]Stat-related progress (Relics, Hero Level) is halted, but saved. These will resume counting the next time you activate Dota Plus on the account. Any Hero sets you\u0027ve purchased from the Shard Shop are still available to you. All other features of Dota Plus are inaccessible after a subscription or membership lapses.[/section]    [section id=stack]  [h3]Is it possible to stack subscription / membership time?[/h3]Yes. If you have a recurring subscription with Dota Plus, applying additional time blocks (memberships) will apply to the account and push out your renewal date accordingly. If you have an active Dota Plus membership, applying additional memberships will push out the expiration date accordingly.[/section]    [section id=gift]  [h3]Can I gift a friend Dota Plus?[/h3]Yes! You can gift Dota Plus memberships to eligible friends under the \u201CGifting\u201D menu in the Dota Plus purchase screen.
