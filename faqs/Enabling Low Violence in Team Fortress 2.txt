How do I enable low violence or censored mode in Team Fortress 2?

Unfortunately, you cannot remove all blood and gore from the game unless you reside in a country with these restrictions. Additionally, Steam Support cannot set your game to low violence mode. However, you can remove most of these violent effects from the game. Please see the two methods of doing so below.

[h4]Launch Options Method:[/h4]
[olist]
[*]Log in to Steam and navigate to your Library. [/*]
[*]Right click on "Team Fortress 2" and choose "Properties...". [/*]
[*]Under the "General" tab go to the section "Launch Options". [/*]
[*]Copy and paste the following line into the text box: [/*]
[code]-sillygibs +violence_ablood 0 +violence_agibs 0 +violence_hblood 0  +violence_hgibs 0[/code]
[*]Close the window and launch the game. [/*]
[/olist]
Team Fortress 2 should now have minimal blood and gore.

[h4]Pyrovision Method:[/h4]You can also equip the Pyrovision Goggles ingame on every class for a similar low violence experience. If you wish you can combine both methods.

For more information on the Pyrovision Goggles and how to attain them, please see the TF2 wiki page [url=http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Pyrovision_Goggles]here[/url].
