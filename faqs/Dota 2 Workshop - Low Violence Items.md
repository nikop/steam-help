* We occasionally need to request alternate low-violence versions of some workshop items with some or all of the following changes:
* Replace or remove human skulls and some types of bones
* Replace or remove excessive wounds or entrails
* Darken or remove bright red blood
* If low violence alternates are requested, they should be submitted to the workshop as new "low-violence" submissions instead of replacing existing submissions.
* If you prepare a low-violence item, it will preview on the regular hero base model in the workshop tool, it is not possible to preview items on a low-violence hero base model.
* Some workshop reference files available through the [Hero Resource](http://www.dota2.com/workshop/requirements) pages include low-violence models, textures or images. Low-violence files will have an "lv" in the file name.

* If you have excessive blood on items, it will be helpful to keep the blood on a separate layer in your texture source file so that it will be easy to darken or remove the blood if this is requested.

##
