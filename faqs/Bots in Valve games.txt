[section id=addingtf2][h2] [/h2][h2]Adding bots in Team Fortress 2:[/h2]To add bots in Team Fortress 2:
[olist]      [*]Launch Team Fortress 2[/*]      [*]Create a Server.[/*]      [*]The number of bots you can spawn, depends on the maximum number of players allowed on the server. Change it via "Max. Players" when creating the server. Note: Not all maps support AI bots, please see wiki for a list of supported maps.[/*]      [*]When in-game, bring up the developer console and enter "tf_bot_quota #". (The # represents how many bots you want in the game)  Alternatively you can use a method such as, "tf_bot_add red 2 sniper easy". (This would spawn 2 Snipers on the Red team, with Easy difficulty.) [/*]  [/olist]By default, Team Fortress 2 will automatically balance the number of players on each team so one team cannot have more than two more players than the other. You can turn this off from your developer console, by typing in mp_autoteambalance 0.
