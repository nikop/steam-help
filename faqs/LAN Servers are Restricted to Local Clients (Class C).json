What\u0027s wrong?[/h3]\n\nGame Servers can be LAN Servers or they can be Internet Servers.\n\nIn order for Internet players to connect to your Server, you must enable your Server to be an Internet Server.  You do this by entering [code]sv_lan 0[/code]in the Server console, in the [b]server.cfg [/b]or in the [b]listenserver.cfg [/b]file.\n\nTypically, only Listenservers (where the Server is also a Client) are LAN Servers by default.\n\nIf you are behind the same router as the Server, then you must connect to your Server using the internal IP address of the Server and and not the external IP address.\n\n",
