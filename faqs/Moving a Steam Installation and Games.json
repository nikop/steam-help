If there is a problem in this process and you do not have a backup of your games or the steamapps folder, it will be necessary to reinstall the games individually. Please see the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4593-5CB7-DC3C-64F0]Using the Steam Backup Feature[/url] topic.[/section]\n\nThe following instructions are a simple way to move your Steam installation along with your games:\n\n[olist]  \t[*]Exit the Steam client application.[/*]  \t[*]Navigate to the Steam installation folder. The default installation location is: [code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam[/code][/*]  \t[*]Delete all of the files and folders except the [i]steamapps[/i] and [i]userdata[/i] folders and [i]steam.exe[/i][/*]  \t[*]Cut and paste the whole Steam folder to the new location, for example: [code]D:\\Games\\Steam\\ [/code][/*]  \t[*]Launch Steam and log into your account.[/*]  [/olist]\n\nSteam will briefly update and then you will be logged into your account. For installed games, [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB]verify integrity of game files[/url] and you will be ready to play. All future game content will be downloaded to the new folder (D:\\Games\\Steam\\steamapps\\ in this example)\n\nIf you encounter any errors during the move process or when Steam is launched from the new location, it may be necessary to perform a more thorough process:\n\n[olist]  \t[*]Exit the Steam client application.[/*]  \t[*]Navigate to the new Steam installation folder. Continuing from the last section\u0027s example, the new location would be: [code]D:\\Games\\Steam\\ [/code][/*]  \t[*]Move the [i]steamapps[/i] folder from the Steam installation folder to your desktop.[/*]  \t[*]Review the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3C73-90F9-F600-0266]Uninstalling Steam[/url] topic for instructions to uninstall Steam (this must be done to remove your old Steam installation settings from the Windows Registry).[/*]  \t[*]Review the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/099E-F5D1-8780-4778]Installing Steam[/url] topic for instructions to re-install Steam to the desired location.[/*]  \t[*]Move the [i]steamapps[/i] folder into the new Steam installation folder to copy downloaded game content, settings, and any saved games that might be stored there to the new location.[section style=important]  [h3]Important Note about Save Games[/h3]If you are moving your Steam installation to a new hard drive and want to keep game saves/profiles for third party games that are not saved on Steam Cloud most of these can be found in your Documents folder: C:\\Users\\[i][Windows user name][/i]\\Documents\\My Games\\. Moving this folder to the same location on your new hard drive will maintain your saves/profiles. If you do not find them in that location for the game you may have to reach out to developer/publisher of the game to determine where the save file location is. Each game developer is able to decide how and where to store save files.[/section][/*]  \t[*]Start Steam and log in to your existing Steam account to confirm that the move was successful.[/*]  \t[*]For installed games, [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB]verify integrity of game files[/url] and you will be ready to play.[/*]  [/olist]",
