If you\u0027re using a Mobile Authenticator through the Steam Mobile App on your smartphone to protect your account, you can confirm via the app. Otherwise you\u0027ll receive a confirmation request via email.\n\n[h3][section id=whattrade]What can I trade?[/section][/h3]Steam items, in-game items and extra copies of games (referred to as Steam Gifts) are tradable. To be sure if an item is tradable, please go to your Inventory and select the item and read the item details. The \u0022Tags\u0022 section will indicate if it is tradable or not.\n\n[img]https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/trading/Tradable.PNG[/img]\n\n[h3][section id=viewinventory]How do I see my inventory on the Steam Community?[/section][/h3]After logging in to your account, hover over your profile name in the top-middle of the Steam screen and select Inventory from the drop-down menu. You can also find a link in the right-hand menu of your profile page.\n\n[h3][section id=seeitems]Who can see my items?[/section][/h3]You can control who sees your items with Inventory privacy settings. The options are public, friends only, or private. You can adjust these settings through your Inventory or your general Profile settings.\n\n[h3][section id=tradegifts]What do you mean by trading Steam Gifts? Can I trade Steam Games?[/section][/h3]Games received as an Extra Copy can be traded to other users. They can be used to trade for other Gifts, or for items in games supporting Steam Trading.  Some older gift purchases on Steam can also be traded.\n\n[h3][section id=usedgames]Does Steam Trading mean I can sell my used games?[/section][/h3]No. Only games that have granted as an extra copy, and thus have never been played, can be traded. Once a Steam Gift is opened and added to your game library, you won\u2019t be able to trade it again.\n\n[h3][section id=addtitle]How do I add a game to my library after receiving it in a trade?[/section][/h3]Go to the game in your Steam Inventory and click \u0022Add to my Library\u2026\u0022 to add it to your library.\n\n[h3][section id=fraud]What if a game I received in a trade is fraudulently purchased?[/section][/h3]Please view the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/558E-7FF0-1C5C-D1EE]Revoked Gifts[/url] article for more information.\n\n[h3][section id=lostitems]I think I just lost items in a trade! What do I do?[/section][/h3]Steam Support will not return any items or gifts that you feel have been traded unfairly. There are no exceptions to this policy.\n\nTo ensure that a scammer is appropriately handled, and to prevent them from benefiting from this scam or others in the future, make sure that you report them through the Steam Community:\n\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4D07-D139-587C-2080]How to Report a Scammer, Hijacker or Phisher[/url]\n\nReporting a scammer through the Steam Community will always be better than submitting a Steam Support ticket containing your report. A community report includes the best information about the interaction between the accounts, and is quicker to review and act on.\n\nTo learn more about scams and trading, please see the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B]Scam FAQ[/url] and the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/18A5-167F-C27B-64A0]Recommended Trading Practices[/url] article.\n\n[h3][section id=scamshijacks]What\u0027s the difference between a scam and a hijack?[/section][/h3]A scam is when a user deceives another user into willingly (at the time) completing a trade, market transaction, or sending a gift. After the trade is completed, the person who was scammed either doesn\u2019t receive what was promised, or the items involved are not what was agreed upon.\n\nA hijacking is when an account or a computer is taken over by someone else without the account owner\u2019s permission. This is often done with malware or a virus. In some cases the hijacker will convince a user to hand over their login information by providing a fake Steam or a third-party trading site. Hijackers most commonly steal accounts to gain items or games, and sometimes commit fraud. Hijackers often use stolen accounts to commit more hijackings. In these cases, we lock the account until the rightful owner contacts us about the hijacking.\n\nFor more information on hijacked accounts, please see the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0A94-F308-34A5-1988]Recovering a Stolen or Hijacked Steam Account[/url] article and the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3B6E-B322-2400-8D24]Steam Item Restoration Policy[/url].\n\nFor more information on scams, please read the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B]Scam FAQ[/url], [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/18A5-167F-C27B-64A0]Recommended Trading Practices[/url] article and the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3B6E-B322-2400-8D24]Steam Item Restoration Policy[/url].\n\n[h3][section id=whatscammers]What happens to scammers?[/section][/h3]If evidence exists that the Steam user is a scammer, Steam Support will ban the account from using the Steam Community, including Trading and using the Steam Market. The length of the ban is dependent on the severity and quantity of the scams. In some cases, scammers will be banned permanently. If a scammer has multiple accounts, all of their accounts may be subject to the ban as well.\n\nIn some cases, scammers will hijack an account and use it to commit scams, fraud or more hijackings. In these cases, we lock the account until the rightful owner contacts us about the hijacking.\n\n[h3][section id=avoidscammers]What are the best ways to avoid getting scammed?[/section][/h3][list]  \t[*]Ignore pressure and do not rush the trade. A common tactic by scammers is to force you to trade quickly so they can change items/gifts in the trade without you noticing.[/*]  \t[*]Ignore the pressure to trust the other user. If you are trading with a user who insists that you trust them, they are probably attempting to scam you. Please note that \u002BRep comments can be generated easily by malicious groups.[/*]  \t[*]Mouse over every item to ensure that the item/gift\u0027s properties are correct. Information about the item/gift will be stated here including the quality, name, description and any effects.[/*]  \t[*]Pay attention to the trade log while making the trade. All changes, additions, removals and actions will be recorded in this box. You may also use it to communicate with the trader.[/*]  \t[*]Ensure that you are trading with the correct user. Scammers may try to impersonate your friends and other trusted traders. It is your responsibility to know who you are trading with.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[h3][section id=tradestoavoid]What trades should I avoid?[/section][/h3]Do not trade for anything that cannot be added into the trade offer itself. The most common examples of these scenarios are the following:[list]\t[*]Trading items/gifts for money outside of the Steam Community market. You cannot add Wallet credit, PayPal, gift cards or any form of money into the trade offer.[/*]  \t[*]Trading items/gifts for CD Keys. You cannot add a CD Key into the trade offer. CD Keys that are offered can be for a different game, fake, used or region restricted.[/*]  \t[*]Trading items/gifts for nothing in return in the first trade and expecting to get an item or gift in a later trade. There is no reason to not trade everything in one trade. You may add unlimited items/gifts to a single trade. A common example of this is using a middleman to facilitate a one sided trade.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[h3][section id=whattodoscammed]What do I do if I was scammed?[/section][/h3]If you are scammed, please use the Report feature built into Steam:\n[list]  \t[*]Go to the profile of the offending user[/*]  \t[*]Click the \u0027...\u0027 drop-down located at the top right of the page[/*]  \t[*]Choose \u0022Report Player\u0022[/*]  \t[*]Select the violation, and follow the prompts to submit the report[/*]  [/list]\n\n[h3][section id=whynotrestore]Why will Steam not return items that were scammed?[/section][/h3]Our community assigns an item a value that is at least partially determined by that item\u0027s scarcity. If more copies of the item are added to the economy through inventory rollbacks, the value of every other instance of that item would be reduced.\n\nWe sympathize with people who fall victim to scams, but we provide enough information on our website and within our trading system to help users make good trading decisions. All trade scams can be avoided.\n\n[h3][section id=tradeban]What is a trade ban?[/section][/h3]A trade ban prevents a Steam account from using the Steam Community, including trading and using the Steam Market. A trade ban can only be applied by a Steam employee. Trade bans are mainly associated with accounts that commit scams.\n\n[h3][section id=probation]What is trade probation?[/section][/h3]While most trade bans are permanent, in some circumstances a user may receive a temporary trade ban. In these cases, when the ban is automatically lifted the offending account also gets placed into trade probation. Probationary status allows other users to know that a user has recently committed a trading related offense so they can make better decisions about whether or not they want to trade with that user. Please note, probationary status does not prevent users from trading.\n\n[h3][section id=baninfo]Why won\u2019t Steam Support provide information on why they trade banned or locked an account?[/section][/h3]By limiting the provided data, Steam Support prevents malicious users from learning how to avoid getting caught in the future. Steam Support relies on several data points to arrive at a decision to ban or lock an account. Users intent on committing malicious activity, most often done to other users, are constantly trying to gain this data to use in future scams, fraud and hijackings.\n\n[h3][section id=icanttrade]I can\u0027t trade! Why not?[/section][/h3]There are different reasons why you may be unable to trade or use the Market. Please see the following [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/451E-96B3-D194-50FC]Trading and Market Restrictions[/url] article for more information.\n\n[h3][section id=feedback]I have ideas for other things in Steam that can be traded. How do I give that feedback?[/section][/h3]You can post feedback or suggestions in our [url=http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/10/]Suggestions/Ideas forum[/url] as it is regularly read by our developers.\n\n",
