--------------------------------------

How do I install custom subtitles for any Source game?

[h2]Compiled (.DAT) Files[/h2]If you already have a compiled [i][i]closecaption_[i]<language>[/i].dat[/i][/i] file, simply copy the file to the following location:

[i][b]NOTE:[/b] The [i]\Steam\[/i] folder is located in [i]C:\Program Files\[/i] or [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\[/i] by default.[/i]
[list]  	[*]  		[i]\Steam\steamapps\common\[game name]\[modname]\resource\[/i]  	[/*]  [/list]
For example, for Half-Life 2, the path would be:
[list]  	[*]  		[i]\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2\hl2\resource\[/i]  	[/*]  [/list]
Then, start the game and ensure closed captioning is enabled in the Options > Audio menu.

To change to the custom language, open the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4700-D10E-26BE-DDDD]console[/url] and enter the following command:
[list]  	[*]  		cc_lang [i]<language>[/i]  	[/*]  [/list]
Where [i]<language>[/i] is the same as the language in the closed caption file name.

[h2]Uncompiled (.TXT) Files[/h2]Text files must be compiled before they will work with Source games. If you have a closecaption_[i]<language>[/i].txt file, then you will need to do the following to compile it:
[olist]  	[*]  		Install the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1C0A-1DEA-CF8A-72F2]Source SDK[/url] from the Tools section of the Steam Library.  	[/*]  	[*]  		Open the Source SDK launcher and ensure you have the correct game selected.  	[/*]  	[*]  		Navigate to the Source SDK [i]\bin\[/i] folder:  		[list]  			[*]  				[i]\Steam\steamapps\common\\SourceSDK\bin\[/i]  			[/*]  		[/list]  	[/*]  	[*]  		Determine which version of the Source engine the game uses, then open that folder. In most cases this will be [i]\orangebox\[/i]  	[/*]  	[*]  		Open the [i]\bin\[/i] subfolder of the engine folder. Inside this folder should be a program named [i]captioncompiler.exe[/i]  	[/*]  	[*]  		Take your closecaption_[i]<language>[/i].txt file, then drag it onto the [i]captioncompiler.exe[/i] program. A file called [i]closecaption_[i]<language>[/i].dat[/i] should appear â€” this is your compiled caption file.  	[/*]  	[*]  		Follow the instructions under [i][b]Compiled (.DAT) Files[/b][/i] using this file.  	[/*]  [/olist]    [h2]Creating Translations[/h2]If you would like to translate closed captions into your own language, please see the following Valve Developer Wiki article on this topic:
