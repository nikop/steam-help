## CURSOR TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

* Each cursor must be 32 pixels by 32 pixels, 24-bit RGB color with 8-bit alpha channel.
* The format of the resulting image must be bmp (with transparency).
* It is no longer necessary to provide .ani files for cursors.
* The hotspots locations for the cursors will be the same as those set for our default cursors.

## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

* The hues, greyscale values, and line widths of the cursors need to read well in all map locations and lighting situations.
* The edges of the images should be as clean as possible.
* Don't force a lot of details into the cursor images if it makes them too busy or hard to read. Keep the design simple and stylized to display as clearly as possible.
