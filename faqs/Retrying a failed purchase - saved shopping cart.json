Any discounts applied to your failed purchase will be saved, even if they are no longer available in the Steam store.\n\nSo if you\u0027re trying to buy a game that\u0027s on sale, but you have trouble purchasing, Steam will let you try the purchase again within the next three days.\n\nWe want you to be able to purchase and enjoy games on Steam. If your purchase fails, the three day period gives you time to sort out the issue with either Steam or your bank.\n\n[url id=findcart][/url]\n\n[h1][b]How do I find my saved cart?[/b][/h1]When your purchase fails, Steam will email you a link to your saved cart. That\u0027s when the three day period begins.\n\nYou can also find a saved cart from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/]your Purchase History page[/url]. A shopping cart that is eligible for you to repurchase will have a shopping cart icon next to it. Click on that purchase and then select \u0022I want to repurchase this saved cart.\u0022\n\n[url id=howtotryagain][/url]\n\n[h1][b]How do I try my purchase again?[/b][/h1]If your failed purchase is eligible to be saved, Steam will email you a link that will take you directly to that cart to try and purchase it again.\n\n[url id=whynotsaved][/url]\n\n[h1][b]Why was my cart not saved?[/b][/h1]There are some situations where we\u0027re unfortunately unable to save your cart. For example, if you have a coupon applied to your purchase, if you\u0027re purchasing a bundle, or if you\u0027re trying to buy a recurring subscription. We\u0027d like to expand this feature to include those in the future.\n\nIf your purchase fails before you attempt to pay for it on the checkout page, we haven\u0027t yet saved your cart. You\u0027ll see a big orange box with a reminder on how long you have to try the purchase again if its eligible.\n\n[url id=extend][/url]\n\n[h1][b]I need more time, can Steam Support extend the 3-day (72 hours) period? [/b][/h1]No, the saved cart will expire after exactly 72 hours. Steam Support cannot change the amount of time remaining. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/]Your Purchase History page[/url] will show exactly how much time is remaining before the saved cart expires.\n\n",
