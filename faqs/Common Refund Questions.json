Even if you fall outside of the refund rules we\u0027ve described, you can submit a request and we\u0027ll take a look at it.\n\n\n[h2]Where is my refund? My refund was approved, but it\u2019s been more than 7 days.[/h2]\nApproved refunds can take up to 7 days to appear in your account \u2013 however, refunds to international payment methods may take longer. If your refund hasn\u2019t appeared after 7 days, please contact your bank directly and ask about pending refunds on your account.\n[section style=note]When a refund request is approved within 24 hours of the purchase, the original transaction is cancelled and the charge drops off your bank statement. In this case, you will not see a credit on your account. This process can take up to 10 days \u2013 wait time for international payment methods may vary.\n[/section]\nStill can\u2019t find your refund? Please review your recent purchase history; you may have used the funds to make another purchase!\n\n\n[h2]I tried to refund an older purchase of mine, but it looks like I can\u0027t. What can I do?[/h2]\nPurchases made significantly outside of the 14 day refund window are not eligible for a refund request.\n\n\n[h2]My refund request was denied. Can I contest this decision?[/h2]\nIf you feel that there has been an error in the handling of your refund inquiry, please submit another request at [url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url]. The request will be reviewed by another Valve employee.\n\n\n[h2]I bought a game right before it went on sale. Can I get a refund and repurchase it at the sale price?[/h2]\nYes; if you have not already requested a refund [url=http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/] make sure the purchase is eligible[/url] and submit a request [url=http://help.steampowered.com]here[/url].\n\nPlease note that approved refunds may take up to 7 days to process.\n\n[h2]Is there a limit to how many purchases I can request a refund for?[/h2]\nYou can submit any number of refund requests for eligible purchases.  If it appears that you are abusing the refund system, we reserve the right to revoke access to this feature.\n\n\n[h2]If I refund a game, will my playtime and achievements be removed from my Steam Community Profile?[/h2]\nNo, playtime and achievements will not be removed from your Steam Community Profile.
