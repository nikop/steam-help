These instructions will help community contributors set up the accounts and tools required for submitting items to the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/570/workshop/]Dota 2 Item Workshop[/url].

There are numerous steps involved with this process but most will only have to be done once to set up a Steam account that can make Workshop submissions. Please be aware that after you submit tax information, the processing and verification may take a few days.

22. If you are making an item in collaboration with Valve, please notify your Valve contact via email of the item ID url of your submission so we can prepare it for shipping in game.

23.  If you want the item to be visible on the Workshop for marketing purposes and to gather votes you should make the item public and add a YouTube video and images of the in-game items. For example, a music pack could have a video with samples of the tracks and a hero set could show various views of the items on the hero in the loadout and while performing actions in-game.

24. IMPORTANT:  Adding Another User (Optional)
[list]
[*]If you are splitting payments with another entity for your item you need to add their Steam account as a friend to your account. [/*]
[*]If they have never accepted the Workshop agreement they must go through steps 1-19 above to be set up as a collaborator. [/*]
[/list]
Here is how to add a friend on Steam:
 
25. If the user you want to split payments with is not in your friends list, have them provide you their Steam Profile URL. 

26. From their Steam Profile page you can click the "Add Friend" button to add them to your friends list. You will have to wait until they have accepted your friend invite before you can continue. 
 
27. Go to the Dota 2 Workshop
