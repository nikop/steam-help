  "content": "The Steam community overlay is an in-game interface that allows access to many Steam Community features while playing games. The default keybind of Shift\u002BTab will open the overlay in any game where it is supported and enabled.\n\nBeyond giving access to Steam community features, many games utilize the overlay in the background to support in-game features that require Steam. You may not even realize that a game is using the overlay in these cases.\n\nBecause the Steam overlay is a customizable Steamworks feature, games will use it differently depending on which features it supports and how the developer incorporated it. More detailed information can be found in the Steam community or by contacting specific game developers.\n\n\n[h1]What can the overlay be used for?[/h1]\n[list]  \t\t\n[*][b]In-game purchasing[/b]\nIf a game offers micro-transactions, item purchases, or any other type of in-game purchasing, the Steam overlay will be required. The overlay enables the game to communicate with Steam and allow your purchase to be made while playing.  \t\t  \t\t\n\n[*][b]Friend, game \u0026 group invites[/b]\nYou can access your friends list, Steam chat, as well as group/game invites while in the overlay. Some games utilize the overlay for party and matchmaking invites. If it is not enabled, the invites will not work.  \t\t  \t\t\n\n[*][b]Screenshots[/b]\nSteam allows screenshots to be captured in-game by using the default keybinding of F12. This feature requires the overlay to capture the screenshots. The screenshots can be accessed in-game by using the overlay as well. \t\t  \t\t\n\n[*][b]Trading \u0026 Market features[/b]\nMany games with in-game inventory systems will use the overlay to allow players access to inventory features while in the game. If a game supports trading or market purchasing while in-game, the Steam overlay will be required. \t\t  \t\t\n\n[*][b]Other community features[/b]\nThe overlay interface gives access to most other features that are available through the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/]Steam website[/url]. Along with access to these features specifically, the overlay has a built in web browser. \t\t  \t\t[/list]  \n\n[h1]Overlay Not Opening[/h1]The overlay interface does not open when pressing its default shortcut (Shift\u002BTab).\n\nThe first thing you\u0027ll want to do is make sure that the Overlay is actually enabled and that your keybinding is correct. Specific instructions can be found below.\n\nIf the overlay is still not opening, make sure to follow all the Basic and Advanced steps in this article. \t\t  \t\t\n\n\n[h1]Overlay Freezes or Becomes Unresponsive[/h1]Because the overlay is a supplemental component of the game you are playing, it will be automatically closed should your system\u0027s resources come under heavy load.\n\nYou\u0027ll want to make sure that your system is in a good state by updating all major drivers, limiting the amount of programs running during gameplay, as well as updating your operating system to its latest version.\n\nDetailed steps can be found in the troubleshooting sections below.\n\n\n[h1]Enabling the Steam Overlay[/h1]\nSteam has a global setting that will enable or disable the Steam overlay:\n\nOpen the Steam client and navigate to the [b]Steam \u003E Settings/Preferences \u003E In-game[/b] tab. Check the box next to [b]Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game[/b].\n\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/faq/overlay_options.JPG[/img]\n\nAdditionally, you can turn on/off the Steam Overlay per game.\n[list][*]Find the game in your Library -\u003E [b]Properties...[/b]  [*]Under the [b]General[/b] tab, you\u0027ll find a checkbox for [b]Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game[/b][/list]\n[section style=note][h3]Steam Overlay Shortcut Keys[/h3]The Steam shortcut allows the overlay to be opened in-game. You\u0027ll want to double check that you have it set correctly.\n\nThe default shortcut is [b]Shift \u002B Tab[/b]. To change the shortcut select [b]Steam \u003E Settings \u003E In-game[/b][/section]\n\n\n[h1]Basic Steam Troubleshooting[/h1]The following steps will ensure that Steam is in a good state for the overlay to work. These can be performed with a minimal amount of technical knowledge.\n\n[h3]Restart Computer[/h3]It\u0027s always a good first step to make sure that you restart Steam as well as your computer.\n\nRestarting the computer flushes all kinds of system states and caches, while resetting other programs and releasing locks on files and other resources.\n\n[h3]Verify Local Game Files[/h3]Sometimes files on hard-disks and other storage devices become corrupted. Some of these files may be associated with the way the game utilizes the overlay. Verifying local files can fix this.\n\nFind Game in Library -\u003E Right click the game or select the gear icon -\u003E Properties... -\u003E Local Files -\u003E Verify Integrity of Game Files...\n\n[h3]Reinstall Steam[/h3]The Steam installer can be downloaded [url=http://store.steampowered.com/about/]here[/url] and reinstalled to the same location where it is already installed.\n\nThis will ensure that all files required by the Steam overlay are in a good state. This process will have no effect on your installed games.\n\nWARNING! Uninstalling Steam will delete all game content.\n\n\n[h1]Advanced Troubleshooting[/h1]If the overlay is still not working correctly after following the fixes outlined above, it is possible that something outside of Steam is responsible.\n\nBecause these are advanced troubleshooting steps, we highly recommend that you contact a local IT support specialist in your area for further assistance with these steps.\n\n[h3]Investigate Firewalls[/h3]Certain firewalls may prevent Steam from communicating with the game that requires it. You\u0027ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that the Firewall is not interfering. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may be necessary to add exceptions in your firewalls for Steam.\n\n[h3]Investigate Anti-Virus Software[/h3]AV software hooks very deep into user systems and can affect disk and network operations which will cause issues with Steam. Some games also use copy protection technology that can appear as malicious software to an AV scanner, resulting in potential false-positive alerts.\n\nYou\u0027ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that your AV software is not interfering with Steam. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may also be necessary to add exceptions for Steam in your AV configuration (for example, excluding Steam Library folders from live monitoring services).\n\n[h3]Investigate Other Programs Interfering[/h3]Any software that modifies or monitors system, disk or network activity can cause issues with the Overlay\u0027s functionality. These programs and services can run in the background and are typically associated with software like Anti-Virus, ad-blockers, web-optimizers, firewalls, system cleaners, recording software, proxies, performance boosters etc.\n\nYou\u0027ll want to work with a specialist to ensure that no outside software is interfering with the Steam Overlay.\n\n[h3]Upgrade Your System[/h3]If your system is at or below the required or recommended specifications for the game, the overlay may have difficulty functioning correctly.\n\nYou\u0027ll want to work with a specialist in your area to consider upgrading your operating system, or even the hardware that your system uses.\n\n",
