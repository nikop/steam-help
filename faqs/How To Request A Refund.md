# How To Request A Refund

Valve will, upon request via [help.steampowered.com](https://help.steampowered.com), issue a refund for any title that is requested within 14 days of purchase and has been played for less than 2 hours. Even if you fall outside of the refund rules we've described, you can submit a request and we'll take a look at it.  
  
Additional information and troubleshooting instructions for existing refund requests can be found in our [Common Refund Questions](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5FDE-BA65-ACCE-A411) FAQ.
