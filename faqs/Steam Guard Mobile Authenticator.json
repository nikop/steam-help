[/url][/*]\n[/list]\n\n[h1][url id=what][/url][b]What is the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/b][/h1]\nThe Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator is a feature of the Steam Mobile App that provides an additional level of security to your Steam account. The authenticator generates a code that you need to enter every time that you log on to your Steam account. The code changes every 30 seconds, can be used only once, and is unguessable.\n\nThis system (commonly called two-factor authentication) is stronger than just your username and a password.\n\nThe Steam Mobile App also includes QR code sign in, a sign in method for Steam that allows you skip entering your user name and password. The process relies on the 2fa credentials stored in your phone app, securely identifying you through your mobile device to Steam.\n\nValve also strongly recommends that you add a phone number to your account, which makes recovering your account quite a bit easier, should you lose access.\n\nYour phone does not need to be connected to the Internet for the authenticator to work (however, your phone does need to know the correct time).\n\n[h4][url id=whyphone][/url]Why should I add a phone number to my Steam account?[/h4]\nAdding a phone to your account gives you more options to recover your account in case you forget your password, or if your account is stolen. You can use SMS messaging to reset your password, or transfer your Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator from one phone to another.\n\n[h4][url id=addphone][/url]How do I add a phone number to my Steam account?[/h4]\nTo add a phone number to your account or manage a previously added phone number:\n[list]  \t\n[*]Log in to Steam (using the application or a web browser) and click on your profile name located in the top right corner.[/*][*]Select \u0027Account Details\u0027 from the dropdown menu.[/*][*]Under \u0027Contact Info\u0027, select \u0027Add a phone number\u0027. If a phone number has already been added to the account, you will see \u0027Manage your phone number\u0027 instead.[/*][*]Enter your phone number and select \u0027Next\u0027. We will send an SMS message containing your confirmation code - Enter this code to verify that we have the correct information.[/*][*]You\u0027re done![/*]  [/list]\nYou will now be able to reset your password or transfer your Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator from one phone to another via SMS.\n\nPlease note that only one phone number can be associated with a Steam account at a time.\n\n[h4][url id=enable][/url]How do I setup a Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/h4]\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6891-E071-C9D9-0134]View the setup walkthrough here[/url]\n\n[h4][url id=login][/url] How do I log in using the authenticator?[/h4]\nAfter you\u0027ve set up the mobile authenticator in the Steam Mobile App, you\u0027ll have three options for confirming your sign ins to the Steam Client or website. \n[list]\n[*] When you sign in to the Steam Client or the Steam website, use the mobile app to scan the QR code shown on the sign in form\n[*] Or you can enter your name and password. Steam will then send a notification to your phone, asking you to confirm your sign in\n[*] Or you can enter your name and password, then choose to enter the Steam Guard code from the mobile app (on the Steam Guard page select \u0022Show Steam Guard code.\u0022\n[/list]\n[section style=warning][b]Never[/b] share your authenticator codes with anyone, and don\u0027t type them in to a web site that isn\u0027t run by Valve.

Instead of entering your account name, password, and a Steam code - you can use the mobile app to scan QR code presented on the sign in panel.\n[list]  \t\n[*]Open the Steam Mobile App. If you are logged in on your phone, go to the Steam Guard menu (the middle \u0022shield\u0022 icon in the bottom navigation bar) for the \u0022Scan a QR code\u0022 prompt.[/*][*]Hold your phone up to the Steam sign in panel and use the mobile app to scan the QR code.[/*][*]After scanning the QR code, the app will show you a confirmation page with details about the sign in attempt, including a map and the approximate geolocation of the device you\u2019re signing in to. If this information looks correct, approve the request to complete your login.[/*]  \n[/list]\n[h4][url id=where][/url]Where is my mobile authenticator code?[/h4]\nOnce you\u0027ve set up your authenticator in the Steam Mobile App, you can find your authenticator code on the Steam Guard page, by selecting \u0022Show Steam Guard code.\u0022\n[/list]\n[h4][url id=nophone][/url] I don\u0027t have a phone. Can I still use the mobile authenticator?[/h4]\nNot at this time. A supported phone is required.\n\n[h4][url id=bestway][/url] What is the best way to use two factor authentication?[/h4]\nFirst, you need to realize that just because you\u0027ve enabled better protection for your account, this does [b]not[/b] give you super powers.\n[list]  \t\n[*][b]Never[/b] share your password or mobile authenticator code with anyone.[/*][*]Don\u0027t type your username, password, or authenticator code into a web site that is not run by Valve. [b]Check links carefully. Bad guys often try clever mis-spellings to make links look like they come from Valve. If you\u0027re in doubt, don\u0027t click on them.[/b][/*][*]Steam Support will [b]never[/b] ask for your password or mobile authenticator code (nor will any Valve employees).[/*][*][b]Never[/b] download and run any program suggested by someone in an email or chat; these are almost certainly scams or malware.[/*][*][b]Never[/b] download and run any program that claims to \u0022clean up\u0022 or \u0022optimize\u0022 or otherwise \u0022fix\u0022 Steam (the program could be malware intended to steal your account).[/*][*][b]Never[/b] provide an SMS recovery or removal code to anyone. These codes are only used to add or remove authenticator devices. [b]Providing a code to someone else is immensely risky.[/b]\n[/list]\nIt\u0027s a good idea to print out a set of [url=#backupcodes]backup codes[/url] that you can use in an emergency.\n\n[h4][url id=disable][/url] How do I disable Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/h4]\nYou can remove two factor authentication from your account by opening the Steam Mobile App, navigating to the Steam Guard page, tapping the gear icon and selecting \u0022Remove Authenticator.\u0022 This will bring you to a confirmation page, where you can confirm your choice.\n\nRemoving the protection of your authenticator will slow down your trades and Community Market listings, to give you additional time to review them.\n\n[h4][url id=devices][/url] What devices does the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator work on?[/h4]\nThe Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator works on Apple iOS devices running iOS 10.0 or later and Android devices running 5.0 or later.\n\n[h1][url id=troubleshooting][/url] [b]Troubleshooting[/b][/h1]\n[section style=important]If you\u0027re having trouble logging in with the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator, please use our help site ([url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url]) to recover your account.[/section]\n\n[h4][url id=restrictions][/url]Why are my items on hold?[/h4]\nAny trades or Market listings created before a Mobile Authenticator is added, or during the first 7 days after it is added, will be held for 15 days. Trades or Market listings created more than 7 days after a Mobile Authenticator is added will not be held by Steam. Adding a Mobile Authenticator will not reduce the length of existing item holds.\n\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/34A1-EA3F-83ED-54AB]Read more about Trade and Market Holds[/url], or why items are held by Steam.\n\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/451E-96B3-D194-50FC]Read more about Trading and Market Restrictions[/url], or why you may be unable to trade or use the Market.\n\n[h4][url id=sold][/url] Help! I sold or lost my phone and I can\u0027t log in anymore! What do I do?[/h4]\nIf possible, you should contact your wireless service provider and get a replacement phone with the same phone number. Steam will be able to send SMS messages to your replacement phone, and you will be able to recover your account as described below.\n\nIf you no longer have access to your phone and don\u0027t have your recovery code, you\u0027ll need the assistance of Steam Support. Use the \u0022Help me with my issue\u0022 button at the top right of this page to get help removing your authenticator. If you don\u2019t have access to the email address that is currently associated with your Steam Account please provide [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/40A0-8B4B-B54B-C51A]proof of account ownership[/url] within your ticket.\n\n[h4][url id=notworking][/url] My authenticator codes aren\u0027t working[/h4]\nIf you are trying to enter an authenticator code and receiving an error, check the time on your phone and make sure it is accurate. The authenticator codes are generated using the phone\u0027s time, and if the time is off, the codes will be incorrect.\n\nIf you have more than one account with an authenticator, make sure you are entering codes for the correct account.\n\n[h4][url id=transfer][/url] Can I transfer my authenticator to my new phone?[/h4]\nYes, you can.\n\nTo transfer your authenticator to a new phone, you\u0027ll need access to the phone number associated with your account (so we can send you a text message to confirm it\u0027s you.)\n\nOn your new phone, install the Steam Mobile App and try to sign in to your account. When the app asks you to confirm your sign in via the app, select \u0022I no longer have access to my authenticator.\u0022 Follow the steps the app provides to transfer your authenticator to the new device.\n\nAfter transferring the authenticator, any new trades or market listings will be held for a couple of days to protect your items in case your authenticator is ever transferred by a malicious person. See our [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/34A1-EA3F-83ED-54AB]Trade Holds FAQ[/url] for more information about trade holds.\n\n[h4][url id=newphone][/url] I\u0027m getting a new phone soon. What do I need to do?[/h4]\nIf you\u0027re keeping your phone number, then you don\u0027t need to do anything in advance to prepare. Once you get your new phone, you can transfer your authenticator to the new phone using the [url=#transfer]steps in the answer for the previous question above.[/url]\n\nIf you have two factor authentication enabled, and you will also lose access to your old phone number, then you should:\n[list]  \t\n[*]Disable the authenticator (go to the Steam Guard page, tap the gear icon, and select \u0022Remove Authenticator\u0022). Note that doing this will prevent you from trading or using the Community Market for 15 days. It is recommended that you [url=#transfer]transfer the authenticator[/url] instead whenever possible.[/*][*]Sign out of your account. Tap your avatar at the top right of the app and select \u0022Sign out.\u0022[/*]  \n[/list]\nBefore you sell or give your phone away, we recommend doing a factory reset on it and removing personal information.\n\n[h4][url id=removephone][/url] How do I remove the phone number from my account?[/h4]\nSign in to Steam and go to your Account Details page.\nIn the Steam Client and Steam website - at the top right of window, select [b]Account details[/b] from your profile name drop-down. In the Contact Info section, select [b]Manage your phone number[/b]. \t\nSelect [b]Remove number[/b]. Follow the provided instructions to confirm the phone number removal.\n\n[h4][url id=backup][/url] Is there a way to get backup codes in case I lose my phone?[/h4]\nYes, you can generate backup codes to use in an emergency. It\u0027s easy:\n[list]  \t\n[*]Sign in to  Steam[/*][*]Go to your profile name drop-down at the top right of the page and select [b]Account Details[/b][/*][*]Select [b]Manage Steam Guard[/b].[/*][*]Select the option to [b]Get Backup Codes[/b].[/*][*]You\u0027ll have to enter the SMS code that is sent to your phone number.[/*][*]You\u0027ll see a page with a number of codes that you can enter instead of the one generated by your phone. Steam will also send email to your account every time new codes are generated, and every time one of these codes is used.[/*]  \n[/list]\nIt\u0027s a good idea to print these codes instead of saving them on your computer. Don\u0027t take a screen shot of them.\n\n[h4][url id=recoverycode][/url]I didn\u0027t save my recovery code, where can I find it?[/h4]\nIn Steam Mobile App, go to the Steam Guard page, tap the gear icon, then tap \u0022My Recovery Code.\u0022\n\n[h4][url id=nosms][/url] I\u0027m not receiving SMS messages![/h4]\nIf you are unable to receive SMS messages from Steam, check with your wireless provider that your wireless account is allowed to receive them. Our text messages can come from a 6 digit phone number, please ensure that your provider supports this. Steam will also stop sending SMS messages if too many have been sent to you, so waiting a few minutes to an hour may allow messages to come through again. You should also check to make sure that your phone\u0027s inbox is not full.\n\n[h4][url id=phonenotworking][/url] Why isn\u0027t my phone number working?[/h4]\nFirst, make sure you are entering your phone in international format (with \u0027\u002B\u0027 and your country code first).\n\nMake sure that your country code is correct (Steam tries to guess where you are in the world, but you can also select your location from the menu below your phone number).\n\nValve does not allow certain phone numbers, such as VoIP numbers and numbers that cannot receive text messages. If your phone number is being rejected and you think that the rejection is in error, please contact Support by clicking on the \u0022Help me with my issue\u0022 button.\n\n[h1][url id=general][/url] [b]General Questions[/b][/h1]\n[h4][url id=VoIPphones][/url]Why is my number being blocked because it\u0027s considered VoIP?[/h4]\nWe are unable to accept new VoIP phone numbers on Steam due to them not meeting our security requirements. If your phone number is blocked because it\u0027s considered VoIP you will need to find a mobile or prepaid phone number to use on Steam. Select carriers use VoIP technology in their cellular plans and we are unable to support these. Our system will notify you when you enter your phone number if we consider it to be a VoIP number.\n\n[h4][url id=morethanone][/url]Can I authenticate my Steam account with more than one device?[/h4]\nNo, your account can only be on one authenticator (Steam Mobile App) at a time.  \n\n[h4][url id=morethanoneaccount][/url]Can I authenticate multiple Steam accounts with my device?[/h4]\nYes, you can authenticate multiple accounts with the app. From the Steam Guard page, tap the blue drop-down, select \u0022Add an account\u0022 and follow the prompts. You\u0027ll receive notifications to confirm the sign ins for all the accounts you\u0027ve added to this authenticator. \n\n[h4][url id=share][/url] Can I share my phone number between multiple accounts?[/h4]\nYes. You may use the same phone number on multiple accounts. Accounts with the same phone number may be treated as the same identity with respect to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, policies, or restrictions.\n\n[h4][url id=cost][/url]Do the SMS messages you send cost me anything?[/h4]\nStandard messaging charges may apply; check your wireless phone plan to confirm.\n\n[h4][url id=noprompt][/url] Why am I not prompted for confirmation I save my sign in credentials in Steam?[/h4]\nIf you trust that access to your PC is secure, you can select \u0022Remember me\u0022 when you sign in to steam. If you do, Steam will only ask you for your password periodically. \n\nYou may choose not to let Steam remember your credentials and require your password (and potentially confirmation) on every sign in. You can change this in Steam\u0027s client settings under the account tab anytime by checking the box at the bottom that says, \u0022Don\u0027t save account credentials on this computer.\u0022\n\n[h4][url id=banbyphone][/url] Do VAC and Game bans apply to all accounts on a phone number?[/h4]\nIf an account that has a phone number registered to it receives a VAC or Game ban, all other accounts that use the same phone number will also receive a ban. If the other accounts do not own the game they will still receive the ban and be unable to purchase the title on that account.\n\nThis feature is not enabled for all games and will be used at the discretion of the developer.\n\n",
