[/url][/*]\n[/list]\n\n[h1][url id=what][/url][b]What is the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/b][/h1]\nThe Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator is a feature of the Steam Mobile App that provides an additional level of security to your Steam account. The authenticator generates a code that you need to enter every time that you log on to your Steam account. The code changes every 30 seconds, can be used only once, and is unguessable.\n\nThis system (commonly called two-factor authentication) is stronger than just your username and a password.\n\nValve also strongly recommends that you add a phone number to your account, which makes recovering your account quite a bit easier, should you lose access.\n\nYour phone does not need to be connected to the Internet for the authenticator to work (however, your phone does need to know the correct time).\n\n[h4][url id=whyphone][/url]Why should I add a phone number to my Steam account?[/h4]\nAdding a phone to your account gives you more options to recover your account in case you forget your password, or if your account is stolen. You can use SMS messaging to reset your password, or transfer your Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator from one phone to another.\n\n[h4][url id=addphone][/url]How do I add a phone number to my Steam account?[/h4]\nTo add a phone number to your account or manage a previously added phone number:\n[list]  \t\n[*]Log in to Steam (using the application or a web browser) and click on your profile name located in the top right corner.[/*][*]Select \u0027Account Details\u0027 from the dropdown menu.[/*][*]Under \u0027Contact Info\u0027, select \u0027Add a phone number\u0027. If a phone number has already been added to the account, you will see \u0027Manage your phone number\u0027 instead.[/*][*]Enter your phone number and select \u0027Next\u0027. We will send an SMS message containing your confirmation code - Enter this code to verify that we have the correct information.[/*][*]You\u0027re done![/*]  \n[/list]\nYou will now be able to reset your password or transfer your Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator from one phone to another via SMS.\n\nPlease note that only one phone number can be associated with a Steam account at a time.\n\n[h4][url id=enable][/url]How do I setup a Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/h4]\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6891-E071-C9D9-0134]View the setup walkthrough here[/url]\n\n[h4][url id=login][/url] How do I log in using the authenticator?[/h4]\nIf your account has the authenticator enabled, you will be asked to enter your current code after you\u0027ve entered your user name and password.\n[list]  \t\n[*]Open the Steam Mobile App. If you are logged in on your phone, go to the Steam Guard menu (the top-most menu selection) to see the current code. (If you aren\u0027t logged in to Steam on your phone, your current code is displayed on the login page).[/*][*]Enter the current code when you are asked to. Don\u0027t worry if the code on your phone turns red and changes, you still have a little bit of time left to enter the old code.[/*]  \n[/list]\nYou can\u0027t use a code more than once, and you can\u0027t use old codes. So if you just used a code, you should wait for the code to change before using another.\n\n[section style=warning][b]Never[/b] share your authenticator codes with anyone, and don\u0027t type them in to a web site that isn\u0027t run by Valve. Steam Support will [b]never[/b] ask for any of your codes.[/section]\n\n[h4][url id=where][/url] Where is my mobile authenticator code?[/h4]\nThe Mobile Steam App provides the current authenticator code for your account.\n[list]\n[*]Open the Steam Mobile App[/*][*]If you\u0027re not logged in, you will see your current code on the login page.[/*][*]If you\u0027re logged in, go to the Steam Guard menu, where your current code will be shown.[/*]  \n[/list]\n[h4][url id=nophone][/url] I don\u0027t have a phone. Can I still use the mobile authenticator?[/h4]\nNot at this time. A supported phone is required.\n\n[h4][url id=bestway][/url] What is the best way to use two factor authentication?[/h4]\nFirst, you need to realize that just because you\u0027ve enabled better protection for your account, this does [b]not[/b] give you super powers.\n[list]  \t\n[*][b]Never[/b] share your password or mobile authenticator code with anyone.[/*][*]Don\u0027t type your username, password, or authenticator code into a web site that is not run by Valve. [b]Check links carefully. Bad guys often try clever mis-spellings to make links look like they come from Valve. If you\u0027re in doubt, don\u0027t click on them.[/b][/*][*]Steam Support will [b]never[/b] ask for your password or mobile authenticator code (nor will any Valve employees).[/*][*][b]Never[/b] download and run any program suggested by someone in an email or chat; these are almost certainly scams or malware.[/*][*][b]Never[/b] download and run any program that claims to \u0022clean up\u0022 or \u0022optimize\u0022 or otherwise \u0022fix\u0022 Steam (the program could be malware intended to steal your account).[/*][*][b]Never[/b] provide an SMS recovery or removal code to anyone. These codes are only used to add or remove authenticator devices. [b]Providing a code to someone else is immensely risky.[/b]\n[/list]\nIt\u0027s a good idea to print out a set of [url=#backupcodes]backup codes[/url] that you can use in an emergency.\n\n[h4][url id=disable][/url] How do I disable Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/h4]\nYou can remove two factor authentication from your account by opening the Steam Mobile App, navigating to the Steam Guard menu item, and selecting \u0022Remove Authenticator\u0022. This will bring you to a confirmation window, where you can confirm your choice by selecting \u0022Remove Authenticator\u0022 again.\n\n[h4][url id=devices][/url] What devices does the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator work on?[/h4]\nThe Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator works on Apple iOS devices running iOS 8.0 or later, Android devices running 4.0 or later, and Windows Phone 8.1 and later.\n\n[h1][url id=troubleshooting][/url] [b]Troubleshooting[/b][/h1]\n[section style=important]If you\u0027re having trouble logging in with the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator, please use our help site ([url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url]) to recover your account.[/section]\n\n[h4][url id=restrictions][/url]Why are my items on hold?[/h4]\nAny trades or Market listings created before a Mobile Authenticator is added, or during the first 7 days after it is added, will be held for 15 days. Trades or Market listings created more than 7 days after a Mobile Authenticator is added will not be held by Steam. Adding a Mobile Authenticator will not reduce the length of existing item holds.\n\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/34A1-EA3F-83ED-54AB]Read more about Trade and Market Holds[/url], or why items are held by Steam.\n\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/451E-96B3-D194-50FC]Read more about Trading and Market Restrictions[/url], or why you may be unable to trade or use the Market.\n\n[h4][url id=restart][/url]Suddenly I\u0027m logged out of the Steam Mobile App and not seeing authenticator codes, what do I do?[/h4]\nMake sure the app is up to date on your phone and restart the app. This is a rare issue, that is commonly solved by restarting the app. Do not delete and reinstall the app. If you delete the mobile app from your phone, you\u0027ll need to reset your authenticator using [url=https://help.steampowered.com]https://help.steampowered.com[/url].\n\n[h4][url id=sold][/url] Help! I sold or lost my phone and I can\u0027t log in anymore! What do I do?[/h4]\nIf possible, you should contact your wireless service provider and get a replacement phone with the same phone number. Steam will be able to send SMS messages to your replacement phone, and you will be able to recover your account as described below.\n\nIf you no longer have access to your phone and don\u0027t have your recovery code, you\u0027ll need the assistance of Steam Support. Use the \u0022Help me with my issue\u0022 button at the top right of this page to get help removing your authenticator. If you don\u2019t have access to the email address that is currently associated with your Steam Account please provide [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/40A0-8B4B-B54B-C51A]proof of account ownership[/url] within your ticket.\n\n[h4][url id=notworking][/url] My authenticator codes aren\u0027t working![/h4]\nIf you are unable to log in using the authenticator codes:\n[list]  \t\n[*]Check the time on your phone and make sure it is accurate. The authenticator codes are generated using the phone\u0027s time, and if the time is off, the codes will be incorrect.[/*][*]If you have more than one account with an authenticator, make sure you are entering codes for the correct account.[/*]\n[/list]\nYou can remove the authenticator from the account; see the section below on [url=#newphone]authenticator recovery[/url].\n\n[h4][url id=transfer][/url] Can I transfer my authenticator to my new phone?[/h4]\nYes, you can.\n\nTo transfer your authenticator to a new phone, you\u0027ll need access to the phone number associated with your account (so we can send you a text message to confirm it\u0027s you).\n\nFrom the Steam Mobile app on your new device, try to log into your account. When the app asks for your authenticator code, select \u0022Please help, I no longer have access to my Mobile Authenticator codes.\u0022 Follow the steps the app provides and you can either transfer your authenticator to the new device or remove it from the previous device.\n\nAfter transferring the authenticator, any new trades or market listings will be held for a couple of days to protect your items in case your authenticator is ever transferred by a malicious person. See our [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/34A1-EA3F-83ED-54AB]Trade Holds FAQ[/url] for more information about trade holds.\n\n[h4][url id=newphone][/url] I\u0027m getting a new phone soon. What do I need to do?[/h4]\nIf you\u0027re keeping your phone number, then you don\u0027t need to do anything in advance to prepare. Once you get your new phone, you can transfer your authenticator to the new phone using the [url=#transfer]steps in the answer for the previous question above.[/url]\n\nIf you have two factor authentication enabled, and you will also lose access to your old phone number, then you should:\n[list]  \t\n[*]Disable the authenticator (go to the Steam Guard menu and select \u0022Remove Authenticator\u0022). Note that doing this will prevent you from trading or using the Community Market for 15 days. It is recommended that you [url=#transfer]transfer the authenticator[/url] instead whenever possible.[/*][*]Log out of your account (go to the Log Out menu on iOS, or go to Settings / Log Out on the Android app).[/*]  \n[/list]\nBefore you sell or give your phone away, we recommend doing a factory reset on it and removing personal information.\n\n[h4][url id=removephone][/url] How do I remove the phone number from my account?[/h4]\nLog into the store in a browser, then:\n[list]  \t\n[*]Go to your [b]Account details[/b] (viewable under your profile name, near the top of the web page).[/*][*]Click on [b]Manage your phone[/b].[/*]  \t\n[*]Click on [b]Remove phone[/b].[/*][*]You can remove the phone by typing in the current code from your Authenticator, or by sending your phone an SMS code. Choose one of these options and follow the instructions.[/*]  \n[/list]\n[h4][url id=backup][/url] Is there a way to get backup codes in case I lose my phone?[/h4]\nYes, you can generate backup codes to use in an emergency. It\u0027s easy:\n[list]  \t\n[*]Log in to the Steam store[/*][*]Go to the account drop-down at the top right of the page and select [b]Account Details[/b][/*][*]Select [b]Manage Steam Guard[/b].[/*][*]Select the option to [b]Get Backup Steam Guard Codes[/b].[/*][*]You\u0027ll have to enter the SMS code that is sent to your phone number.[/*][*]You\u0027ll see a page with a number of codes that you can use instead of the one generated by your phone. Steam will also send email to your account every time new codes are generated, and every time one of these codes is used.[/*]  \n[/list]\nIt\u0027s a good idea to print these codes instead of saving them on your computer. Don\u0027t take a screen shot of them.\n\n[h4][url id=recoverycode][/url]I didn\u0027t save my recovery code, where can I find it?[/h4]\nLog in to the Steam Mobile App, from the main menu select Steam Guard, and on the Steam Guard page you\u0027ll see a menu option for \u0022My Recovery Code\u0022. For security purposes, if you\u0027re unable to log into the Steam Mobile App, you will not be able to view your recovery code.\n\n[h4][url id=nosms][/url] I\u0027m not receiving SMS messages![/h4]\nIf you are unable to receive SMS messages from Steam, check with your wireless provider that your wireless account is allowed to receive them. Our text messages can come from a 6 digit phone number, please ensure that your provider supports this. Steam will also stop sending SMS messages if too many have been sent to you, so waiting a few minutes to an hour may allow messages to come through again. You should also check to make sure that your phone\u0027s inbox is not full.\n\n[h4][url id=phonenotworking][/url] Why isn\u0027t my phone number working?[/h4]\nFirst, make sure you are entering your phone in international format (with \u0027\u002B\u0027 and your country code first).\n\nMake sure that your country code is correct (Steam tries to guess where you are in the world, but you can also select your location from the menu below your phone number).\n\nValve does not allow certain phone numbers, such as VoIP numbers and numbers that cannot receive text messages. If your phone number is being rejected and you think that the rejection is in error, please contact Support by clicking on the \u0022Help me with my issue\u0022 button.\n\n[h1][url id=general][/url] [b]General Questions[/b][/h1]\n[h4][url id=VoIPphones][/url]Why is my number being blocked because it\u0027s considered VoIP?[/h4]\nWe are unable to accept new VoIP phone numbers on Steam due to them not meeting our security requirements. If your phone number is blocked because it\u0027s considered VoIP you will need to find a mobile or prepaid phone number to use on Steam. Select carriers use VoIP technology in their cellular plans and we are unable to support these. Our system will notify you when you enter your phone number if we consider it to be a VoIP number.\n\n[h4][url id=morethanone][/url] Can I use multiple phones to authenticate my Steam account?[/h4]\nNo, only one authenticator can be active on an account at any one time.\n\n[h4][url id=share][/url] Can I share my phone number between multiple accounts?[/h4]\nYes. You may use the same phone number on multiple accounts. You may enable Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator on multiple accounts on the same phone by logging in to each account within the app and following the procedure to enable the authenticator on each account. The app will provide codes for all accounts regardless of which account is currently logged in to the app. Accounts with the same phone number may be treated as the same identity with respect to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, policies, or restrictions.\n\n[h4][url id=cost][/url]Do the SMS messages you send cost me anything?[/h4]\nStandard messaging charges may apply; check your wireless phone plan to confirm.\n\n[h4][url id=noprompt][/url] Why am I not prompted for a code when I save my login credentials in Steam?[/h4]\nTo make logging into your account faster, we do not require a code if you have saved your Steam client credentials. You may choose not to save your credentials and require a code on every login. You can change this in Steam\u0027s client settings under the account tab anytime by checking the box at the bottom that says, \u0027Don\u0027t save account credentials on this computer\u0027.\n\n[h4][url id=banbyphone][/url] Do VAC and Game bans apply to all accounts on a phone number?[/h4]\nIf an account that has a phone number registered to it receives a VAC or Game ban, all other accounts that use the same phone number will also receive a ban. If the other accounts do not own the game they will still receive the ban and be unable to purchase the title on that account.\n\nThis feature is not enabled for all games and will be used at the discretion of the developer.\n\n",
