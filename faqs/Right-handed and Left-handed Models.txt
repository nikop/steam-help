How do I switch my weapon from one hand to the other?

[h4]Team Fortress 2[/h4]To switch to left-handed models in Team Fortress 2, please use this process:
[list]
[*]Launch Team Fortress 2. [/*]
[*]Go to Options and then to the Multiplayer tab [/*]
[*]Click Advanced [/*]
[*]Check the box next to "Flip viewmodels" [/*]
[/list]
[h4] [/h4][h4]Gold Source games (Counter-Strike, Half-Life)[/h4]If you cannot switch your weapon to the right-hand, please go to your advanced video options and change the renderer to either [b]OpenGL[/b] or [b]Direct3D[/b]. The software renderer does not support right-handed models.

You can select left or right-handed models by typing the following command into the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4700-D10E-26BE-DDDD]Console[/url]:
[list]
[*]To use your left-hand: [code]cl_righthand 0[/code] [/*]
[*]To use your right-hand: [code]cl_righthand 1[/code] [/*]
[/list]
To permanently use left-handed models, you may create a [b]userconfig.cfg[/b] file with the [code]cl_righthand 0[/code] command. Please follow these instructions to create a userconfig.cfg file:
[olist]
[*]Locate the subfolder in your game folder that holds the [b]config.cfg[/b] file

For example, you can find the config.cfg file for Counter-Strike at [Steam installation directory]\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike\cstrike\config.cfg [/*]
[*]Create a new text file in that directory called [b]userconfig.cfg[/b] [/*]
[*]Open the file with Notepad and enter [code]cl_righthand 1[/code] (to use the right-handed model) or [code]cl_righthand 0[/code] (to use the left-handed model) [/*]
[*]Save the file [/*]
[*]Launch the game to test the userconfig.cfg settings [/*]
[/olist]
