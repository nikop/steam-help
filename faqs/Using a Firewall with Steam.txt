Using a Firewall with Steam
Updated 2021-08-04 22.23.14

How should I configure my firewall to work with Steam?

[section style=important]  [h3]Important:[/h3]If you are installing Steam for the first time or if there has been a recent Steam update, a firewall may be preventing Steam from connecting to the Steam Network.

You may be asked to re-authorize Steam after a client update. Some Steam games may also prompt for firewall authorization after a game update.[/section]    [h4]Troubleshooting Steps[/h4][olist]  	[*]Close the Steam client application.[/*]  	[*]Open the configuration view for your firewall program, and remove any instances of the following executables from the permissions:
[list]  		[*]steaminstall.exe[/*]  		[exclude_realm=china][*]steam.exe[/*][/exclude_realm]  		[exclude_realm=global][*]steamchina.exe[/*][/exclude_realm]  		[*]hl.exe[/*]  		[*]hl2.exe[/*]  		[*]steamTmp.exe[/*]  	[/list]  	[/*]  	[*]Start Steam. Your firewall should prompt you to set new permissions for steam.exe. If it does not, the security settings may be too strict - you will need to change these settings so you will be prompted to set permissions.

Give the Steam executables permission for all TCP and UDP ports when prompted.[/*]  	[*]Restart your computer and start Steam.[/*]  [/olist]    [h4] [/h4]If you are still having connectivity problems, you may try the following test:
[list]  	[*]Exit the Steam client.[/*]  	[*]Temporarily disable your firewall.[/*]  	[*]Restart Steam and test connectivity.[/*]  	[*]Re-enable your firewall.[/*]  [/list]
If Steam operates normally only when your firewall is disabled, please recheck your firewall configuration. You may wish to contact the provider of your firewall for configuration help. [b]We do not recommend leaving your firewall disabled.[/b]
