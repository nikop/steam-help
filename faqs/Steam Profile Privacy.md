How do I adjust my Steam profile privacy settings?  
  
There are three states of profile privacy: Public, Friends Only, and Private. Each state has additional subcategories to control how you appear to other members of the Steam community.  
  
If you are logged in to Steam, you can change your Privacy Settings by navigating to your [Profile Privacy Settings Page](https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings).  
  
Alternatively, you can navigate to the Profile Privacy Settings page manually:  
  

* From your Steam Profile, click the *Edit Profile* link under your displayed badge.
* Click the *My Privacy Settings* tab
* Select your privacy state (any settings changed are saved automatically)
