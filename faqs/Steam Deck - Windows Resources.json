You can switch this to landscape once Windows is installed.\n[*]To enter your product key during installation, you\u0027ll need internet. Because there are no Wi-Fi drivers at this point, you\u0027ll need a USB-C hub with an Ethernet port for internet.\n[*]Both Windows 10 and Windows 11 are supported. For Windows 11, make sure you have the latest OS update (in order to get the latest BIOS with fTPM support) before installing.\n[/list]",
