This will be indicated to you during the purchase process. As an example, you will be able to purchase multiple Index Base Stations within one cart purchase, but only one Index Headset.\n\n[h4]Will my hardware be shipped together?[/h4]Due to the size differences between products, it is possible that your shipment will be in multiple packages. If it is, don\u2019t worry - they will be shipped at the same time and all be tied to the same master tracking number.\n\n[h4]How do I refund or replace my hardware?[/h4]Look for detailed instructions on returning Hardware in our [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/04AE-8A9A-F64E-D165]RMA Guide[/url].\n\nIf you\u2019ve already returned your hardware and you want to know the return\u2019s status, or the refund has not been processed within three weeks of the return date, please contact [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware]Steam Support[/url].\n\n[h4]What happens if my order can\u2019t be delivered?[/h4]When the carrier is unable to deliver an order, it is returned to our shipping warehouse. All charges, including shipping, are automatically refunded back to the original payment method.\n\nUndeliverable orders cannot be shipped again; instead, you will need to re-order the products.\n\nNote: You will be charged the price displayed during checkout at the time of your purchase. If you previously purchased hardware during a sale and the product is returned as undeliverable, that same discount cannot be applied if it has since expired. Likewise, Steam Support is unable to apply discounts from previous sales.\n\n[h4]What if my order is lost in-transit or stolen?[/h4]Please contact [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware]Steam Support[/url] to report any lost or stolen device orders.\n\n[h4]My package is held at a ParcelShop (EU and UK only)[/h4]For hardware orders made through the Steam Store in the European Union or United Kingdom:\n\nIf you have not received your shipment it may be stored at a GLS or DHL depot (ParcelShop). This happens if the carrier cannot locate your address or no one was present to sign and accept the delivery. When a shipment is held at a ParcelShop, it will not be re-delivered. If the shipment is not picked up by the customer during their limited hold period, the shipment will be returned to our warehouse.\n\nUse the [url=https://gls-group.eu/EU/en/depot-parcelshop-search]GLS ParcelShop finder[/url] or [url=https://parcelshopfinder.dhlparcel.com/]DHL ParcelShop finder[/url] to find the ParcelShop closest to you and check whether they are holding your shipment so that you can arrange to go pick it up. If they are holding your shipment but you are unable to collect it during their holding period, contact the carrier\u2019s service team to refuse the shipment and expedite the return process.\n\nNOTE: Depending on your region, the carrier may have tried to deliver your order to a neighbor and may have left a notification card.\n\n[h4]Is your hardware shipment issue not listed here?[/h4]If your issue isn\u0027t covered here, please contact [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware]Steam Support[/url].\n\n",
