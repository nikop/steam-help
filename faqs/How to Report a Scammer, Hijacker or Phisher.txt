Reporting a scammer, hijacker or phisher through their Steam Profile will always be better than submitting a Steam Support ticket containing your report. A community report includes the best information about the interaction between your accounts, and is quicker to review and act on.

To avoid scams in the future, ensure that you know the methods that a malicious user may use to attempt to scam. You can find detailed information in the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B]Scam FAQ[/url].

If you are scammed, phished or hijacked, please use the Report feature built into Steam:
