[*]If the item involved needs to be confidential, you will have the option to mark your submission "Hidden" at the end of the process. Valve admins are still able to see hidden submissions.

REVENUE SHARE RESTRICTIONS
[/h2]
[list]
[*]Please be aware that revenue shares cannot be changed once an item is submitted. If you have to change revenue shares on an unshipped item, you will need to do a new item submission and inform Valve of the new workshop URL so the correct workshop ID and revenue shares will be used for the item.  [/*]
[*]Revenue shares and the related accounts cannot be changed on an item after it ships. For more information about workshop payments, see the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoppaymentinfofaq]Workshop Payment FAQ[/url]. [/*]
