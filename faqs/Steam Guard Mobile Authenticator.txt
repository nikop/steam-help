[h1][url id=what][/url][b]What is the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/b][/h1]
The Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator is a feature of the Steam Mobile App that provides an additional level of security to your Steam account. The authenticator generates a code that you need to enter every time that you log on to your Steam account. The code changes every 30 seconds, can be used only once, and is unguessable.

This system (commonly called two-factor authentication) is stronger than just your username and a password.

The Steam Mobile App also includes QR code sign in, a sign in method for Steam that allows you skip entering your user name and password. The process relies on the 2fa credentials stored in your phone app, securely identifying you through your mobile device to Steam.

Valve also strongly recommends that you add a phone number to your account, which makes recovering your account quite a bit easier, should you lose access.

Your phone does not need to be connected to the Internet for the authenticator to work (however, your phone does need to know the correct time).

[h4][url id=whyphone][/url]Why should I add a phone number to my Steam account?[/h4]
Adding a phone to your account gives you more options to recover your account in case you forget your password, or if your account is stolen. You can use SMS messaging to reset your password, or transfer your Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator from one phone to another.

[h4][url id=addphone][/url]How do I add a phone number to my Steam account?[/h4]
To add a phone number to your account or manage a previously added phone number:
[list]
[*]Log in to Steam (using the application or a web browser) and click on your profile name located in the top right corner. [/*]
[*]Select 'Account Details' from the dropdown menu. [/*]
[*]Under 'Contact Info', select 'Add a phone number'. If a phone number has already been added to the account, you will see 'Manage your phone number' instead. [/*]
[*]Enter your phone number and select 'Next'. We will send an SMS message containing your confirmation code - Enter this code to verify that we have the correct information. [/*]
[*]You're done! [/*]
[/list]
You will now be able to reset your password or transfer your Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator from one phone to another via SMS.

Please note that only one phone number can be associated with a Steam account at a time.

[h4][url id=enable][/url]How do I setup a Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/h4]
[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6891-E071-C9D9-0134]View the setup walkthrough here[/url]

[h4][url id=login][/url] How do I log in using the authenticator?[/h4]
If your account has the authenticator enabled, you will be asked to enter your current code after you've entered your user name and password.
[list]
[*]Open the Steam Mobile App. If you are logged in on your phone, go to the Steam Guard menu (the middle "shield" icon in the bottom navigation bar) to see the current code. (If you aren't logged in to Steam on your phone, your current code is displayed on the login page). [/*]
[*]Enter the current code when you are asked to. Don't worry if the code on your phone turns red and changes, you still have a little bit of time left to enter the old code. [/*]
[/list]
You can't use a code more than once, and you can't use old codes. So if you just used a code, you should wait for the code to change before using another.
[section style=warning][b]Never[/b] share your authenticator codes with anyone, and don't type them in to a web site that isn't run by Valve. Steam Support will [b]never[/b] ask for any of your codes.

[h4][url id=qrlogin][/url] How do I log in using the QR code sign in?[/h4]
The Steam Mobile App allows you to scan a QR code to sign in to Steam on your PC or in a browser. Instead of entering your account name, password, and a Steam code - you can use the mobile app to scan QR code presented on the sign in panel.
[list]
[*]Open the Steam Mobile App. If you are logged in on your phone, go to the Steam Guard menu (the middle "shield" icon in the bottom navigation bar) for the "Scan a QR code" prompt. [/*]
[*]Hold your phone up to the Steam sign in panel and use the mobile app to scan the QR code. [/*]
[*]After scanning the QR code, the app will show you a confirmation page with details about the sign in attempt, including a map and the approximate geolocation of the device youâ€™re signing in to. If this information looks correct, approve the request to complete your login. [/*]
[/list]
[h4][url id=where][/url] Where is my mobile authenticator code?[/h4]
The Mobile Steam App provides the current authenticator code for your account.
[list]
[*]Open the Steam Mobile App [/*]
[*]If you're not logged in, you will see your current code on the login page. [/*]
[*]If you're logged in, go to the Steam Guard menu, where your current code will be shown. [/*]
[/list]
[h4][url id=nophone][/url] I don't have a phone. Can I still use the mobile authenticator?[/h4]
Not at this time. A supported phone is required.

[h4][url id=bestway][/url] What is the best way to use two factor authentication?[/h4]
First, you need to realize that just because you've enabled better protection for your account, this does [b]not[/b] give you super powers.
[list]
[*][b]Never[/b] share your password or mobile authenticator code with anyone. [/*]
[*]Don't type your username, password, or authenticator code into a web site that is not run by Valve. [b]Check links carefully. Bad guys often try clever mis-spellings to make links look like they come from Valve. If you're in doubt, don't click on them.[/b] [/*]
[*]Steam Support will [b]never[/b] ask for your password or mobile authenticator code (nor will any Valve employees). [/*]
[*][b]Never[/b] download and run any program suggested by someone in an email or chat; these are almost certainly scams or malware. [/*]
[*][b]Never[/b] download and run any program that claims to "clean up" or "optimize" or otherwise "fix" Steam (the program could be malware intended to steal your account). [/*]
[*][b]Never[/b] provide an SMS recovery or removal code to anyone. These codes are only used to add or remove authenticator devices. [b]Providing a code to someone else is immensely risky.[/b]
[/list]
It's a good idea to print out a set of [url=#backupcodes]backup codes[/url] that you can use in an emergency.

[h4][url id=disable][/url] How do I disable Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator?[/h4]
You can remove two factor authentication from your account by opening the Steam Mobile App, navigating to the Steam Guard menu item, and selecting "Remove Authenticator". This will bring you to a confirmation window, where you can confirm your choice by selecting "Remove Authenticator" again.

[h4][url id=devices][/url] What devices does the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator work on?[/h4]
The Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator works on Apple iOS devices running iOS 8.0 or later, Android devices running 4.0 or later, and Windows Phone 8.1 and later.

[h4][url id=restrictions][/url]Why are my items on hold?[/h4]
Any trades or Market listings created before a Mobile Authenticator is added, or during the first 7 days after it is added, will be held for 15 days. Trades or Market listings created more than 7 days after a Mobile Authenticator is added will not be held by Steam. Adding a Mobile Authenticator will not reduce the length of existing item holds.

[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/451E-96B3-D194-50FC]Read more about Trading and Market Restrictions[/url], or why you may be unable to trade or use the Market.

[h4][url id=restart][/url]Suddenly I'm logged out of the Steam Mobile App and not seeing authenticator codes, what do I do?[/h4]
Make sure the app is up to date on your phone and restart the app. This is a rare issue, that is commonly solved by restarting the app. Do not delete and reinstall the app. If you delete the mobile app from your phone, you'll need to reset your authenticator using [url=https://help.steampowered.com]https://help.steampowered.com[/url].

[h4][url id=sold][/url] Help! I sold or lost my phone and I can't log in anymore! What do I do?[/h4]
If possible, you should contact your wireless service provider and get a replacement phone with the same phone number. Steam will be able to send SMS messages to your replacement phone, and you will be able to recover your account as described below.

If you no longer have access to your phone and don't have your recovery code, you'll need the assistance of Steam Support. Use the "Help me with my issue" button at the top right of this page to get help removing your authenticator. If you donâ€™t have access to the email address that is currently associated with your Steam Account please provide [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/40A0-8B4B-B54B-C51A]proof of account ownership[/url] within your ticket.

[h4][url id=notworking][/url] My authenticator codes aren't working![/h4]
If you are unable to log in using the authenticator codes:
[list]
[*]Check the time on your phone and make sure it is accurate. The authenticator codes are generated using the phone's time, and if the time is off, the codes will be incorrect. [/*]
[*]If you have more than one account with an authenticator, make sure you are entering codes for the correct account. [/*]
[/list]
You can remove the authenticator from the account; see the section below on [url=#newphone]authenticator recovery[/url].

[h4][url id=transfer][/url] Can I transfer my authenticator to my new phone?[/h4]
Yes, you can.

To transfer your authenticator to a new phone, you'll need access to the phone number associated with your account (so we can send you a text message to confirm it's you).

From the Steam Mobile app on your new device, try to log into your account. When the app asks for your authenticator code, select "Please help, I no longer have access to my Mobile Authenticator codes." Follow the steps the app provides and you can either transfer your authenticator to the new device or remove it from the previous device.

After transferring the authenticator, any new trades or market listings will be held for a couple of days to protect your items in case your authenticator is ever transferred by a malicious person. See our [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/34A1-EA3F-83ED-54AB]Trade Holds FAQ[/url] for more information about trade holds.

[h4][url id=newphone][/url] I'm getting a new phone soon. What do I need to do?[/h4]
If you're keeping your phone number, then you don't need to do anything in advance to prepare. Once you get your new phone, you can transfer your authenticator to the new phone using the [url=#transfer]steps in the answer for the previous question above.[/url]

If you have two factor authentication enabled, and you will also lose access to your old phone number, then you should:
[list]
[*]Disable the authenticator (go to the Steam Guard menu and select "Remove Authenticator"). Note that doing this will prevent you from trading or using the Community Market for 15 days. It is recommended that you [url=#transfer]transfer the authenticator[/url] instead whenever possible. [/*]
[*]Log out of your account (go to the Log Out menu on iOS, or go to Settings / Log Out on the Android app). [/*]
[/list]
Before you sell or give your phone away, we recommend doing a factory reset on it and removing personal information.

[h4][url id=removephone][/url] How do I remove the phone number from my account?[/h4]
Log into the store in a browser, then:
[list]
[*]Go to your [b]Account details[/b] (viewable under your profile name, near the top of the web page). [/*]
[*]Click on [b]Manage your phone[/b]. [/*]
[*]Click on [b]Remove phone[/b]. [/*]
[*]You can remove the phone by typing in the current code from your Authenticator, or by sending your phone an SMS code. Choose one of these options and follow the instructions. [/*]
[/list]
[h4][url id=backup][/url] Is there a way to get backup codes in case I lose my phone?[/h4]
Yes, you can generate backup codes to use in an emergency. It's easy:
[list]
[*]Log in to the Steam store [/*]
[*]Go to the account drop-down at the top right of the page and select [b]Account Details[/b] [/*]
[*]Select [b]Manage Steam Guard[/b]. [/*]
[*]Select the option to [b]Get Backup Steam Guard Codes[/b]. [/*]
[*]You'll have to enter the SMS code that is sent to your phone number. [/*]
[*]You'll see a page with a number of codes that you can use instead of the one generated by your phone. Steam will also send email to your account every time new codes are generated, and every time one of these codes is used. [/*]
[/list]
It's a good idea to print these codes instead of saving them on your computer. Don't take a screen shot of them.

[h4][url id=recoverycode][/url]I didn't save my recovery code, where can I find it?[/h4]
Log in to the Steam Mobile App, from the main menu select Steam Guard, and on the Steam Guard page you'll see a menu option for "My Recovery Code". For security purposes, if you're unable to log into the Steam Mobile App, you will not be able to view your recovery code.

[h4][url id=nosms][/url] I'm not receiving SMS messages![/h4]
If you are unable to receive SMS messages from Steam, check with your wireless provider that your wireless account is allowed to receive them. Our text messages can come from a 6 digit phone number, please ensure that your provider supports this. Steam will also stop sending SMS messages if too many have been sent to you, so waiting a few minutes to an hour may allow messages to come through again. You should also check to make sure that your phone's inbox is not full.

[h4][url id=phonenotworking][/url] Why isn't my phone number working?[/h4]
First, make sure you are entering your phone in international format (with '+' and your country code first).

Make sure that your country code is correct (Steam tries to guess where you are in the world, but you can also select your location from the menu below your phone number).

Valve does not allow certain phone numbers, such as VoIP numbers and numbers that cannot receive text messages. If your phone number is being rejected and you think that the rejection is in error, please contact Support by clicking on the "Help me with my issue" button.

[h1][url id=general][/url] [b]General Questions[/b][/h1]
[h4][url id=VoIPphones][/url]Why is my number being blocked because it's considered VoIP?[/h4]
We are unable to accept new VoIP phone numbers on Steam due to them not meeting our security requirements. If your phone number is blocked because it's considered VoIP you will need to find a mobile or prepaid phone number to use on Steam. Select carriers use VoIP technology in their cellular plans and we are unable to support these. Our system will notify you when you enter your phone number if we consider it to be a VoIP number.

[h4][url id=morethanone][/url] Can I use multiple phones to authenticate my Steam account?[/h4]
No, only one authenticator can be active on an account at any one time.

[h4][url id=share][/url] Can I share my phone number between multiple accounts?[/h4]
Yes. You may use the same phone number on multiple accounts. You may enable Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator on multiple accounts on the same phone by logging in to each account within the app and following the procedure to enable the authenticator on each account. The app will provide codes for all accounts regardless of which account is currently logged in to the app. Accounts with the same phone number may be treated as the same identity with respect to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, policies, or restrictions.

[h4][url id=cost][/url]Do the SMS messages you send cost me anything?[/h4]
Standard messaging charges may apply; check your wireless phone plan to confirm.

[h4][url id=noprompt][/url] Why am I not prompted for a code when I save my login credentials in Steam?[/h4]
To make logging into your account faster, we do not require a code if you have saved your Steam client credentials. You may choose not to save your credentials and require a code on every login. You can change this in Steam's client settings under the account tab anytime by checking the box at the bottom that says, 'Don't save account credentials on this computer'.

[h4][url id=banbyphone][/url] Do VAC and Game bans apply to all accounts on a phone number?[/h4]
If an account that has a phone number registered to it receives a VAC or Game ban, all other accounts that use the same phone number will also receive a ban. If the other accounts do not own the game they will still receive the ban and be unable to purchase the title on that account.

This feature is not enabled for all games and will be used at the discretion of the developer.
