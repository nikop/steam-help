Launching with -autoconfig or -safe mode
[/h3]
If Dota 2 is failing to start after preparing to launch, we recommend that you attempt to launch with either the -autoconfig or -safe launch option in that order.
[section style=note]

Note:
[/h3]
Only one of these launch options can be used at a time. Once you are able to launch this game, you will need to remove these launch options if you wish to change any video settings.

Using the -autoconfig launch option
[olist]
[*]Open Steam
[*]Go to the "Library"
[*]Right-click the game which needs to be reconfigured
[*]Select "Properties" from the menu
[*]Go to the "Launch Options" section in the window

Reacquiring all Dota 2 files
[/h3]
This should be done if you think some of the game's files may be corrupt, or if you have overwritten any game files with custom assets or mods and you wish to restore the game to its original state. If your game was working previously but is now crashing or freezing and you have completed the above instructions under the [url=#verify]Verifying your game files[/url] section with no results, try this next.
[b]For Windows computers:[/b]
[olist]
[*]Exit Steam entirely.
[*]Browse to your Steam installation (Usually C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\)
[*]Rename the "steamapps" folder to "old_steamapps"
[*]Re-launch Steam and re-install the game.
[*]Once the installation is complete, test the issue.
[*]If this resolves the issue, you may copy the new files into the "old_steamapps" folder and rename it to "steamapps" to restore your other games without re-downloading.
[*]If the issue is not resolved, you can rename the folder back to avoid having to re-install other games.
