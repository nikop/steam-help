  "content": "Steam Remote Play allows games to be launched on one computer, while being played from other devices connected to Steam. With Remote Play Together, you can invite your Steam Friends to join your local co-op sessions remotely, without having to own or launch the game themselves.\n\nBy utilizing the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about]Steam Link app[/url], Remote Play access can be extended to any supported device with the app installed.\n[list]  \t\n[*][url=#how]How does Remote Play work?[/url]\t\n[*][url=#support]How can I tell if a game supports Remote Play?[/url]\n[*][url=#howdoiuseit]How do I use Remote Play?[/url]\n[*][url=#howdoidisableit]How do I disable Remote Play?[/url]\n[*][url=#improvement]How do I improve my streaming experience?[/url]\n[*][url=#communitygroup]Is there a community group?[/url]\n[/list]\nTroubleshooting:\n[list]  \t\n[*][url=#basic]Basic Troubleshooting[/url]\n[*][url=#knownissues]Known issues[/url]\n[/list]\n[url id=how][/url]\n[h1]How does Remote Play work?[/h1]\nSteam Remote Play works by connecting you to a game on one computer when the game process is actually running on another computer elsewhere. Through Steam, game audio and video is captured on the remote computer and sent to the device. The game input (keyboard, mouse or gamepad) is sent from the device you are using to the game process on the remote computer.\n\nAny two computers connected to Steam can be used to stream a gameplay session and this can enable playing games on systems that would not traditionally be able to run those games. For example, a Windows only game could be streamed from a Windows PC to a Steam Machine running Linux in the living room. A graphically intensive game could be streamed from a beefy gaming rig in the office to your low powered laptop that you are using in bed. You could even start a game on one computer and move to a more comfortable location and continue playing it there.\n\n[url=http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamhardware/InHomeStreamingDiagram.jpg][img]http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamhardware/InHomeStreamingDiagram_t.jpg[/img][/url]\nOverview of streaming from a PC to a Steam Machine\n\n[url id=support][/url]\n[h1]How can I tell if a game supports Remote Play?[/h1]\nAll Steam games can be played streaming between your own computers. If a game supports Remote Play Together or has been identified as a good game for streaming to devices using the Steam Link app, that will be listed on the game\u0027s Steam store page, in the game details on the right side of the page.\n\n[url id=howdoiuseit][/url]\n[h1]How do I use Remote Play?[/h1]\n[b]Remote Play Anywhere[/b]\n[olist]  \t\n[*]Log in to the Steam client on the computer with the installed game you wish to play.\n[*]Now, Log into Steam on another computer or a supported device with [url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about/]Steam Link app[/url] installed.\n[*]From there, you can launch and play the game remotely from the Steam Library.\n[/olist]\n\n[b]Remote Play Together[/b]\n[olist]  \t\n[*]Launch your game.\n[*]Make sure your friend is logged in to Steam from a supported device.\n[*]Open your Steam Overlay in-game (Shift\u002BTab).\n[*]From your friends list, right-click your friend and select \u0027Remote Play Together\u0027.\n[*]Once your friend accepts the invite, they will be in-game with you.\n[/olist]\n\n[url id=howdoidisableit][/url]\n[h1]How do I disable Remote Play?[/h1]\nSteam Remote Play allows access to the host computer outside of the game being streamed. Because you are logged into your Steam account on both computers, it is assumed you have full access to both computers. If you don\u2019t want a remote Steam session to be able to access your computer, you can easily turn off the feature in the Steam Remote Play settings.\n\n[url id=improvement][/url]\n[h1]How do I improve my streaming experience?[/h1]\n[b]Hardware:[/b]\nWe recommend a minimum of a quad-core CPU for the computer running the game. The client has more modest requirements, but should have a GPU that supports hardware accelerated H264 decoding. Any recent laptop or PC should meet the client requirements.\n\n[b]Network:[/b]\nWe recommend using a wired network for the best streaming experience. People have had some success with powerline networks and wireless N and AC networks with good signal, though your experience may vary.\n\n[b]Game Settings:[/b]\nTo improve your streaming experience, you can go into your game settings and lower your resolution and turn off vertical sync.\n\n[b]Steam Settings:[/b]\nIn the Remote Play settings you can change a number of things that can affect your experience. You can change your preference for speed vs quality, limit the network bandwidth, and adjust the maximum capture resolution.\n\n[url id=communitygroup][/url]\n[h1]Is there a community group?[/h1]\nYes, you can join the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream]Steam Remote Play[/url] community group and discuss the feature with thousands of other players.\n\n[url id=basic][/url]\n[h1]Issues \u0026 Troubleshooting[/h1]Steam Remote Play is designed to require minimal setup, provided the game you are trying to play is already launching correctly on the primary PC. If you are experiencing a problem, try resolving it by following the troubleshooting info in this article. If you continue to experience the problem, or are encountering an issue that isn\u0027t covered here, you can always reach out and submit a detailed report to [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamLinkApp]Steam Support[/url].\n\n[list]  \t\n[*][url=#knownissues]Known issues[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#networkports]What network ports does streaming use?[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#broadcastfailed]The computers don\u0027t see each other[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#updatedrivers]I haven\u0027t updated video drivers[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#dpiaware]Steam looks really small on the host after streaming[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#quiterror2]I get \u0022The streaming client exited unexpectedly (2)\u0022[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#nvidialaptop]Steam crashes or black screen when hosting from an NVIDIA laptop[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#blackscreen]I see a black screen when streaming a game[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#intelhardwareencoding]How do I enable Intel hardware encoding?[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#nvidiahardwareencoding]How do I enable NVIDIA hardware encoding?[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#nvidiadeblockingsoftware]I see persistent smearing on the screen with NVIDIA hardware encoding[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#nvidiadeblockingmacosx]I see big blocky color areas with NVIDIA hardware encoding[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#muteaudio]I don\u0027t hear any audio when streaming a game[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#nocontrollerinput]My game controller input doesn\u0027t affect the game[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#nomousekeyboardinput]My mouse and keyboard input don\u0027t affect the game[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#invisiblemouse]My mouse cursor is invisible on Windows 8 or Windows 10[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=#advancedtroubleshooting]How do I diagnose streaming performance problems?[/url][/*]  [/list]    \n[h2]Basic Troubleshooting[/h2]Before you get too far down the troubleshooting path, it\u0027s a good idea to complete the entire setup process to ensure you are ready to use Remote Play.\n\n[olist]  [*]First, you\u0027ll want to make sure that Steam is up to date on both PCs. If you are using the Steam Link app, follow the appropriate setup guide [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/7E9D-27C8-EB08-21D9]here[/url].[/*]  [*]Now, from the machine that will be hosting the Remote Play session, you\u0027ll want to launch the game at least once to ensure it\u0027s up to date and working correctly.[/*]  [*]If you are using Remote Play Anywhere, make sure you are logged in to the same Steam account on the remote device. From that Library, you should see the game listed as installed, with the option to \u0027Stream\u0027 instead of \u0027Play\u0027[/*]  [*]If you are using Remote Play Together, your friend should see that you are in-game in their friends list. You should see them as online.[/*]  [*]If the game supports Remote Play Together, you can open the overlay in-game (Shift\u002BTab) and invite your friend from the friends list.[/*]  [/olist]\n\nIf Remote Play still isn\u0027t working correctly, you\u0027ll want to have a look at the known issues below for more information. If that fails, you can always reach out and submit a ticket to [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamLinkApp]Steam Support[/url]. We ask that you provide a detailed report including the exact steps that you take to reproduce the behavior, so that we can isolate the issue and better provide a solution.\n\n[url id=knownissues][/url]\n[h1]Known issues[/h1]\nGeneral:\n[list]  \t[*]There is currently no indication of whether Steam is able to bind the discovery port 27036, but if that fails no other computers will show up in the remote computer list in the Remote Play settings.[/*]  \t[*]If a game takes a long time to launch, it will time out on the client but will start anyway. Retrying the launch will connect to the running game. If this happens consistently for any particular game, please report it on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/1]bug discussion group[/url].[/*]  \t[*]If your game loses focus, Steam will start streaming the desktop so that you can get back to it. This is a feature of Steam Remote Play.[/*]  \t[*]Streaming non-Steam games in the Steam library may work but is not officially supported.[/*]  \t[*]Surround sound is not currently supported and is converted to stereo.[/*]  \t[*]Voice recording over streaming is not currently supported.[/*]  \t[*]Streaming may not perform well when streaming to older systems with a single or dual core CPU and no hardware accelerated H264 decoding.[/*]  \t[*]DirectInput controllers other than gamepad style controllers (wheels, flight controllers, etc.) are not currently supported. Other controllers using XInput are fully supported.[/*]  \t[*]Certain games like \u0022Rome: Total War\u0022 use older DirectX technology which is not currently supported.[/*]  [/list]\nWindows:\n[list]  \t[*]Streaming from a Windows XP host is not supported.[/*]  \t[*]UAC dialogs prevent streaming. If you\u0027re a game developer, please avoid requiring elevated permissions to run your game.[/*]  [/list]\nmacOS:\n[list]  \t[*]Streaming from a macOS host is supported on macOS 10.8 and newer.[/*]  [/list]\nSteamOS / Linux:\n[list]  \t[*]In order to support streaming game controllers on a Linux host computer, /dev/uinput or /dev/input/uinput needs to be readable and writable by Steam.[/*]  \t[*]Currently, there is no rumble support for Linux machines.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[url id=networkports][/url]\n[h3]What network ports does streaming use?[/h3]Streaming uses UDP ports 27031 and 27036 and TCP ports 27036 and 27037. Please make sure Steam can listen on these ports in your firewall software.\n\n[url id=broadcastfailed][/url]\n[h3]The computers don\u0027t see each other[/h3]Make sure they are on the same subnet and no other program is using UDP port 27036, which is used for the initial discovery protocol. If another program has bound this port, please report which program it is on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/1]bug discussion group[/url].\n\nIf you\u0027re running a Mac client, try rebooting after Steam is updated.\n\nSome people have also reported that custom firewalls or software like Hamachi interferes with the discovery process.\n\n[url id=updatedrivers][/url]\n[h3]I haven\u0027t updated video drivers[/h3]A number of bugs have been fixed in the latest video driver releases that may affect streaming. If you are getting poor performance, graphical glitches or black screens please make sure you have the latest drivers installed from your video card vendor\u0027s website.\n\n[url id=dpiaware][/url]\n[h3]Steam looks really small on the host after streaming[/h3]Exit Steam, right click Steam.exe and bring up the compatibility properties, uncheck \u0022Disable display scaling on high DPI settings\u0022, save the changes and restart Steam.\n\n[url id=quiterror2][/url]\n[h3]I get \u0022The streaming client exited unexpectedly (2)\u0022[/h3]You can look in the streaming client log to get more details about what happened. On Windows this file is on the local computer in streaming_client.exe.log in the Steam directory. On Linux this file is on the local computer in /tmp/streaming_client.log.\n\n[url id=nvidialaptop][/url]\n[h3]Steam crashes or black screen when hosting from an NVIDIA laptop[/h3]There is a bug in the NVIDIA driver which causes a crash or black screen if you\u0027re streaming from a laptop with Windows 8.1. Try opening the NVIDIA control panel and under 3D settings, set Steam to use integrated graphics, and then restart Steam.\n\n[url id=blackscreen][/url]\n[h3]I see a black screen when streaming a game.[/h3]If it\u0027s a specific game that is having the issue, please report which game is having the issue on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/1]bug discussion group[/url].\n\nIf all games are having the issue, please try the following:\n\n[list]  \t[*]Update your video drivers on both computers, if you haven\u0027t already[/*]  \t[*]Try disabling hardware encoding in the advanced host settings on the remote computer.
