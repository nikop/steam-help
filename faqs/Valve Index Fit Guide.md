If you don't know your IPD, experiment with the slider until you find the clearest image.

### Removing headset
Without adjusting anything, hold the headset with both hands, pull away from your face and slide it up and back until the head strap feels loose. Lift the headset off your head.  
  
You should be able to slide the headset on and off without making any additional adjustments.

*Fits like a glove.*  
[/td][/tr]  
[/table]  
  
Valve’s Index Controllers are designed to give you smarter hands in VR. There are several adjustment mechanisms in place that can help you find your perfect fit. You’ll know you are ready to get started when:  
  

* Your index finger rests comfortably on the trigger.
* The pad of your thumb rests naturally on the Track Button’s surface without obscuring the LED above or the System Button below.
* The hand strap rests behind your knuckles on the back of your hand.
* For added security, tighten the Index Controllers to your wrists using the provided lanyards.

### Slide your hand into the Hand Strap
Locate the strap release button on the grip and press it to open the Hand Strap.  
  
Make a flat open hand and slide it between the strap and grip.

### Grab the Controller
Rest your index finger on the trigger and thumb on the Track Button.

### Fine tune the Adjustment Arm
If you are having trouble reaching all the inputs, try sliding the arm up or down.  
  

* If your thumb is resting above the Track Button, adjust the strap arm down.
* If your thumb is resting below the top of the Track Button, adjust the strap arm up.

### Finger tracking issues?
Make sure to rest your  index finger on the trigger and other fingers on the sensor area of the controller.  
  
Drum your fingers along the handle to help improve dynamic calibration.  
  
**Note: not all VR content supports Index Controller finger tracking.*
