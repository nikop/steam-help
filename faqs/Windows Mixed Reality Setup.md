# Windows Mixed Reality and SteamVR
Windows Mixed Reality is Microsoft's hardware and software platform for augmented and virtual reality experiences. The current generation of Mixed Reality Headsets are available from Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung.  
  
#### First Steps
[h5]Set up your Windows Mixed Reality Device:[/h5]If you haven’t already, make sure that you have installed both the [Windows Mixed Reality Headset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/set-up-windows-mixed-reality) and the [Windows Mixed Reality Portal.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/install-windows-mixed-reality)  
  
[h5]Make sure your system meets the requirements:[/h5]The [requirements for Windows Mixed Reality headsets](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4039260/windows-10-mixed-reality-pc-hardware-guidelines) may differ from those of SteamVR.  
  
PC requirements vary for available apps & content on Steam. Please see the minimum requirements per title. Additionally we've found that running SteamVR on a PC with a GTX 1070 video card (or equivalent) and an Intel Core i7 processor on the latest version of Windows works well with a broad range of SteamVR applications.  
  
If your PC does not meet these specs you won't be blocked from running Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR however this may impact the performance and quality of the overall experience.  
  
You can also use the [SteamVR performance test](http://store.steampowered.com/app/323910/SteamVR_Performance_Test/) to see if your system is SteamVR ready.  
  
#### [Download the installer](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/SteamWindowsMRInstaller.exe) for SteamVR and Windows Mixed Reality

* Run the installer and create an account.
* Launch [SteamVR](steam://run/250820) when ready to begin the tutorial.
