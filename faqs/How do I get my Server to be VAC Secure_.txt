Enabling VAC security requires a different process for the different types of dedicated servers.

[h4]Steam Dedicated Servers[/h4]The process for enabling VAC security is the same for [b]Steam Half-Life Dedicated Servers[/b] and [b]Steam Source Dedicated Servers[/b].
[olist]
[*]Launch your Steam Dedicated Server from the Steam [b]Tools[/b] tab. [/*]
[*]Make sure the [b]Secure (Valve Anti-Cheat)[/b] checkbox is checked. [/*]
[*]Start the server. [/*]
[/olist]
[h4]Standalone Dedicated Servers[/h4]VAC Security is enabled by default for Standalone Dedicated Servers. To turn VAC security [b]OFF[/b] for your Standalone Dedicated server add [i]-insecure[/i] to your launch switches.
