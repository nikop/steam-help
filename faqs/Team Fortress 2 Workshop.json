Trust us, this is the hardest part.[/*]  \t[*]Design: Draw in 2D or 3D what it will actually look like.[/*]  \t[*]Model: Using a 3D program, create the clean polygon model that will actually be in the game.[/*]  \t[*]Pelt: Unwrap the 3D model like a bearskin rug (UVs) so you can texture map it.[/*]  \t[*]Paint: Using your UVs as a guide, pick a color. Paint a color. Repeat.[/*]  \t[*]Skin: Bind the model to a joint for articulation.[/*]  \t[*]Compile: Use itemtest and don\u2019t forget to make an LOD![/*]  \t[*]Test: Load the itemtest map and look at your item on the character.[/*]  \t[*]Publish: Upload it to the steam workshop![/*]  [/olist]\n\n[url id=publishitem][/url]\n\n[h4]How does the item publishing process work?[/h4][olist]  \t[*]You create an item that meets the submission requirements.[/*]  \t[*]You test your item using the in-game \u0027itemtest\u0027 map.[/*]  \t[*]You publish your item to the Steam Workshop through the in-game item publishing tool.[/*]  \t[*]We review your item and potentially select it to be added to the game.[/*]  \t[*]If selected we contact you then integrate the item into Team Fortress 2.[/*]  \t[*]We test your item.[/*]  \t[*]We add it to the game and split the money your item generates in the Mann Co. store with you.[/*]  [/olist]\n\n[url id=itemtools][/url]\n\n[h4]What software tool should I use to make my item?[/h4]It varies depending upon the project, but this is generally what we use:\n\n[list]  \t[*][url=http://usa.autodesk.com/maya/]Maya[/url] (models, textures, skeletons, morphs, animation)[/*]  \t[*][url=http://www.photoshop.com/]Photoshop[/url] (textures)[/*]  \t[*][url=http://www.pixologic.com/]Zbrush[/url] (detail models, morphs and textures)[/*]  \t[*][url=http://www.3d-coat.com/]3Dcoat[/url] (models and textures)[/*]  \t[*][url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=13565063\u0026siteID=123112]Mudbox[/url] (models and textures)[/*]  \t[*][url=http://www.wings3d.com/]Wings3D[/url] (models only, but it\u2019s free)[/*]  \t[*][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/401090/MODO_indie/]Modo indie[/url] (models and textures)[/*]  \t[*][url=http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/]3DS-Max[/url] (models, textures, skeletons, morphs, animation)[/*]   [/list]\n\n[url id=l2model][/url]\n\n[h4]Where can I find good tutorials to learn 3D modeling?[/h4]Search for \u0022speed modeling\u0022 on [url=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=speed\u002Bmodelling\u0026aq=f]YouTube[/url] and visit the [url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Model_Creation_Overview]source developer wiki[/url]. There are a lot of digital art communities online with great information. Here are a couple that we like to visit:\n\n[list]  \t[*][url=http://www.polycount.com/forum]http://www.polycount.com/forum[/url][/*]  \t[*][url=http://www.wings3d.com/paulthepuzzles/aardvarks.html]http://www.wings3d.com/paulthepuzzles/aardvarks.html[/url][/*]  [/list]\n\n[url id=watchmego][/url]\n\n[h4]I am a 3D artist, how do I get started?[/h4]First, you\u2019ll need to install the [url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SDK_Installation]Source Developer Kit (SDK)[/url].\n\n[url id=polycount][/url]\n\n[h4]What are the polycount limits on my items?[/h4]Keep the polycount similar to what\u0027s already in the game. Try to keep hats under 800 polygons, and weapons under 8,000.\n\n[url id=textureres][/url]\n\n[h4]What resolution should my textures be?[/h4]Texture sizes should not be larger than 512x512. For hats, 256x256 is usually large enough.\n\n[url id=objtga][/url]\n\n[h4]I\u0027ve made an .obj file and .tga, how do I test them in game?[/h4]Use the itemtest wizard.\n\n[url id=existingassets][/url]\n\n[h4]Where can I get the models of the existing characters so I can build my item in context?[/h4][url=http://media.steampowered.com/apps/tf2/workshop/TF_heads.zip]Download this zip file[/url] which contains the .obj files and textures for all the TF classes.\n\n[url id=texturetip][/url]\n\n[h4]Any tips on creating textures?[/h4]Maintain the same texture density of other models in the world (Nothing higher res or lower res than what\u0027s next to it. For hats, maintain team colors, if not - neutral colors (see color swatch below.) Character textures are less noisy/detailed than everything else in the game. Character items/hats should match that style.\n\n[url id=artstyle][/url]\n\n[h4]What are some guidelines for matching TF2\u0027s art style and improving the chances of my item getting in?[/h4]This is a tricky question we grapple with daily. When we started, the game followed an idealized 1950\u2019s-60\u2019s Americana look. Nothing too modern, hyper-realistic or overly \u0022cartoony\u0022. Clearly the art style has evolved over the years, but here are some guidelines that you should keep in mind as you create your items.\n\n[list]  \t[*]Hats should maintain the personality of the character (heavy\u0027s boxing Gloves , Scout\u0027s batter\u0027s helmet, etc.)[/*]  \t[*]TF generally has realistic proportions, with slightly exaggerated aspects to emphasize certain areas.[/*]  \t[*]Try and avoid fine surface details. No scales, skin pores, fabric textures, super detailed normals, etc. Take a look at giant size of the TF characters hands and imagine what they would build.[/*]  \t[*]Try and use flat colors that are close to the [url=http://www.teamfortress.com/contribute/images/tips_palette.gif]TF color family[/url] that the base game uses. Try and avoid full black, full white, or fully saturated colors.[/*]  \t[*]Use a subtle vertical gradient and a subtle ambient occlusion layers multiplied over the colors.[/*]  [/list]\n\n[url id=reportitem][/url]\n\n[h4]What types of items should be reported?[/h4]Any inappropriate items, including but not limited to, racism, sexuality, or prejudice. Also any copyright or stolen material should be reported as well. For more information please review the Steam Subscriber Agreement [url=http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/]here[/url].\n\n[url id=beenreported][/url]\n\n[h4]What if someone keeps reporting items that are not violating any terms?[/h4]Users who repeatedly report items that do not violate terms will receive a lower reputation themselves and thus will not benefit from doing this.\n\n",
